```text
I've seen true beauty;
it was made,
of the most dazzling blues
that even on a sunny day,
made the sky, look gray;
the richest browns,
so pure and fine,
that even the most
gorgeous chocolate,
grows mold in my eyes;
and the brightest white,
I cannot describe,
that to everything else,
now, I am blind
