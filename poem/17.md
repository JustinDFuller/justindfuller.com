```text
I asked God
the meaning of life,
but it turns out,
I disagree

He claimed it to be
all about Him
and his majesty

If I'm being
perfectly honest
that seems
kind-of selfish
and perhaps
a bit pompous

So I set out
to ask that question
to everyone I meet

What I heard,
  family
  friendship
  love
  success
  power
  sadness
  death
made no sense
until I realized,
life has only the meaning
that we give it
```
