```
The crescendo, 
cacophony,
a boorish wave
strikes my drums

The hammer
smites my nerves,
sensation places his shackles
around my wrists,
declares himself my master

Let him have it, I say,
that destitute shell;
for after a tierce,
I am away

Journeying inward
devoid of perception,
Philo grasps my trembling hand,
leading me to
the court of Justicia,
the hall of Sophia

I study under their gaze,
this inpenetrable fortress,
this fraudulent solitude
