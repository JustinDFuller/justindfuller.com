```
When will we abandon
the idol
of labor
for the god
of life

Drink!
No, not the spoiled vinegar
of success
Take this cup
  of meaning
  of love

Have we forgotten?
That we can create
for more than money?
Why not beauty -
for beauty's sake?

But, instead -
"Those who don't work are lazy"

As if our work is important
                  useful
                  meaningful

No, I say those who work
are lazy
They take the easy route
          the lazy route
to life
   meaning
   passion

There is more
but we must
search
```
