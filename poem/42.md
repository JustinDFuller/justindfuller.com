```text
How can you see yourself
as anything other
than the epitome
of beauty?

When you speak,
is there anything other
than wisdom
      empathy
      kindness?

Can everyone not perceive?
Have I been struck
with some lucky ability
to recognize true beauty
when it stands before me?

You wear your heart
on your sleeve
You do not hide

To be perfectly honest
this terrifies
    and confuses me

It's something I could never do

I'm not as brave as you

And yet,
you are not naive
you understand people
you understand me
you see right through me

You are terrifying beauty
You are wisely proud
You are gently smart

What more
can I say?
```
