```text
  As the default configuration
  is less than desirable,
  you should immediately consider
  the following tweaks

  First, you should note
  the sensors are linked
  directly to the controls.
  This is suboptimal because
  any input can cause
  an unwanted behavior

  You should reroute the sensors
  through the central processor,
  allowing it to determine
  what is to be done
  with each sensation

  However, one may find
  the velocity of sensation
  to quickly overwhelm the processor.
  This brings about the next change,
  that most input is to be ignored.

  Now you must manually
  assent to, deny, or withold
  judgement on each input

  But what should you assent to?
  Only that which is aligned with nature.
  Which is a made up concept
  that means:

That which you think right.
