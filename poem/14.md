```text
I love a good heresy,
as much as the next guy

Don't think that thought!
  I think I  will

Don't ask that question!
  Don't mind if I do

What's got you so scared,
scared to be wrong?
Try it sometime,
it's actually quite fun

In fact, I'm doing it now
being wrong,
wrong in nine different ways

The only problem,
you see,
is that I don't know how,
don't know where,
where I'm wrong

For that I visit
the church of heresy,
kneel at the altar
of curiosity

There I meet God,
which one?
You might know.

To find out
you'll need a little
heresy
