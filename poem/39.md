```text
It can happen
on the quietest street
or the busiest avenue;
in the smallest house
or the greatest mansion

I found it
sitting on the floor
building trains
with my son

In the living room
singing and dancing
to Hamilton
with my daughter

Huddled over the crib
whispering my baby to sleep

I found it
in Hyde park
on an unusually sunny day
just you and I
when we were young

It's there
with my doodle's head
resting on my feet
as I work

It's everywhere
in everything
at every moment

I just have to remember
to look
```
