```text
Remember me,
when I die;
don't bury me
in a tomb
of wood, or stone,
but of history

To be hated
by my neighbor
is to be a nuisance,
but by his kin,
infamy

To be loved
by my son
is a bond,
but by his son,
legacy

Not my body
will preserve,
but this ink;
It's not me
they'll remember,
but these words

Immortality,
out of reach,
even with my name
on every tongue;
my memory,
in every heart,
for all of time

Me?  I'll be,
a million, trillion particles,
afloat in the universe
```
