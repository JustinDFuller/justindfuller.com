```
What if we're connected
to the ones we love the most
by an invisible cord
that extends from host to host?

The sensations of connection
produced directly
from this bond

Think about it

New love is hot
because the link
is newly smelted
and has not yet cooled

But as it has not set
it may easily split

Old love is steady
because the link has hardened

But when left unchecked
it becomes inflexible

Then, it may get in the way
and must be painfully removed

This link is why it hurt
when we were far apart

But once the link expanded
the pain did fade away

To keep its health
I prescribe a regimine
of heating
   cooling
   hammering
   twisting

As long as it's attached
