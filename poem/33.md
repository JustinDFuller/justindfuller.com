```
To abandon expectation
is to be rid
of disappointment;
All who let the shroud of desire
fall to their feet,
will notice also
discontentment,
lying dormant on the floor,
a lathargic hound,
his bite a distant memory;
but now,
which dogmatic montra
to take up its place?
That stoic aversion
of all that does not align
with nature?
But which nature to align to?
How about,
an epicurean pursuit
of pleasure?
But which can one taste
while shunning
the tantalizing eye of desire?
Perhaps only the silence
of that final dream
will bring the reprieve
we seek;
Shall we sit and wait
or usher it forward?
Better yet,
can we accept,
take up the path fortune designed?
Can we simply enjoy the hike; 
divets, thorns, and all?
Without searching for
that mystic trail
that does not exist
