```text
The rain,
wetter today;
have you noticed?
and the stars, edible;
I've just had one.
Like the virus of Eden,
it infected me.
Long before, I began living.
Only then did I begin to think.
Inoculated by Babel? No.
The virus consumes me;
now, bursts forth among you.
The universe, born from nothing;
yet, existed eternally.
Two incompatible truths.
A brute fact, a logical necessity.
I am a brute fact,
as are you.
