In my mind
there is no separation
between you
and passion

I constantly sip
from your beauty
yet my thirst
is never quenched

I long for more
with each taste

The deeper I venture
into your love
the deeper I wish
to go

With each revelation
of your heart
   your soul
I see your true beauty
more clearly

You, the opposite
of an empty vessel
(superficial beauty
but empty inside)

You are beauty
through and through
```
