My three little critters
rise before the dawn,
Daddy, will you play with me?
They cry and tug my arm

Eyes open to open eyes,
will pit against will;
One to stay asleep,
the other, to start the day

I stumble to the bathroom,
my three little ducks
all in a row;
Wash my face, brush teeth,
change without privacy

At the stairs, Daddy up!
Do the silly run?
Hey, what about me?
Up and down again

Will you eat a banana? No
Cereal? No. Bagel? No.
Then what do you want?
Can I have a banana?

Two coffees, four baristas,
one dog ready to go out,
one spilled milk,
one childish squabble;
Stop to take my zolies

Trash to go out,
dishes in the sink,
did everyone eat?
Is everyone dressed?
The dog wants pets,
Daddy ew! We need a diaper.

My three little lovelies,
ready for the day
