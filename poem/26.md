```text
Who am I?
I don't want to know

Even in front 
of the mirror,
I close my eyes;
Even in the quiet
room of my thoughts,
I hum a tune

A little of you,
a little gentler,
a little less brave

Am I the sun?
Rising in the hopeful east,
Setting in the lonely west

A little of you,
a little more open,
a little less righteous

Am I who I want to be?
And how would I know?

Even if you tell me,
I'll cover my ears

A little of you,
a little more collected,
a little more skeptical

Am I the moon?
Reflecting you,
No life of my own

Who am I?
I want you to know
