```text
Uneven love,
is there any other kind?

What's worse,
to hand your heart over,
or hold another's 
in your hands?

To watch them 
treat it carelessly,
or agonize over
every misstep,
lest you break it?

And why would we agree,
to such an arrangement,
but that we have
no other choice

For uneven love,
itself uneven;
one day
you hand your heart over,
the next, I, mine

Over and over,
children in a game;
shattering,
mending,
carefully and carelessly,
until we are
no more
