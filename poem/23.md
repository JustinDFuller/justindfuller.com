```text
The foolish boy,
what did he expect?
He asked for patience,
I gave him
three energetic kids;
He asked for wisdom,
I gave him questions to answer;
He asked for courage,
I gave him difficult times

Did he expect
a bolt of courage
from above?
Wisdom slipped
into his mind
as he sleeps?

No, I designed him
with these muscles
from the start

All that's left
is to exercise them;
Shall I lift the weights for him?

What's next, will he sneeze
and pray for someone
to wipe his nose?
```
