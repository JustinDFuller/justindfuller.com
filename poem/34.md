```text
We're talking,
but through a brick wall;
I hear your words,
sure,
and you hear mine,
but not my heart,
not my soul

I want you to hear it,
I really do;
I let out
the faintest whisper,
but no more

Let's take out
our hammers,
smash holes
in this wall

Let me pour you a glass
of my desire;
an unfiltered cup
of my adoration;
I have so much
to share

My hammer is ready;
I'll hire a wrecking crew,
will you?

But I won't,
because you'll reject me
and I'll be left
without even the whisper
that I hear now
```
