```text
I used to be
so scared of death;
Used to be,
I couldn't talk,
couldn't think
about it

My body felt so close,
like it was ready
to slip away
at any moment;
every little twinge
and I thought
  "This is it"

At least,
until you came along;
grabbed me by the shoulders,
stared me square in the eyes

I am going to die.
So are you.
So is everyone you love.

Eventually,
everything you've ever known,
ever touched,
will turn to dust;
not even a memory

You can't fight it
You can't change it

You can only pretend
and deny it
    ignore it

Or, accept it,
embrace it,
make the most of it
```
