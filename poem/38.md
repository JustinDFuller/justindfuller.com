```text
I'm not looking
for love like wine
drunk, fun, out of control

I have love like water
cool, clear, refreshing

Love like the rapids
is exhilerating
and exhausting
I'm here
for the smooth,
steady ride
on the current

We'll hold hands
never growing tired
watching the birds
fly over our heads

I used to think
as we float down the river
we'd get bored,
drift apart
that the current 
would weaken and slow

How wrong I was
How glad I am
```
