I see a blue Subaru and wonder if it's you.

Just the other day, I doubled back to check.
It wasn't you.
It was at IKEA,
where we walked the loop
and stole Lingonberry juice.
Where you stared out the window,
admiring your cute little Subaru.

Just the other day, I saw a blue SUV 
with Christmas stickers down the side.
It wasn't a Subaru.
It stole the breath from my lungs.
I remember the first time I saw yours,
decorated in Halloween stickers all down the side.
That was the first night we kissed.
That wasn't the first night I failed
to tell you what you deserved to know.

Tomorrow I will see a Subaru 
and think fondly of the times we had.
Today I see one and my chest pulls tight.
I held your hand in that Subaru, 
I stared into your eyes, 
I kissed you and asked,
what are you thinking about?
If only you had told me.
Maybe things would be different.
If only I had told you.
Maybe we could have worked it through.

Right now, in the back seat of that Subaru, 
are there the blankets I stained with wine?
God, I embarrassed myself around you.
Like the time I struggled with chopsticks
and you graciously brought me a fork instead.
That time wasn't in your Subaru 
but my little hatchback.
I really hoped you would think it's cool, 
or cute, 
or fun.
That time you rode with me, 
why didn't I tell you?
That time you rode with me, 
could I have saved you from myself?

Now, none of that matters.
Except when I see a blue Subaru.
I think of you.
