```text
And what of the will?
That most broken
of organs

Conditioned from birth
we must never assert
Instead, to be
  humble
  patient
  meek

But are those that
  break
the will
  humble
  patient
  meek?

No!

Anything but.

My child,
assert your will.
Wield it.
I will show you how
I vow not to break it
but to sharpen it

Do not sheath this sword
but hold it high
with pride
     anger

Yes,
what of the will
indeed

What will we make of it?
