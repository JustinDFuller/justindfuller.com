```text
I sit on the sidewalk
as you pass me by;
hold out my hat,
shake it a little;
  spare any praise,
  praise for the insecure?

From the corner of your eye,
you size me up,
judge if I'm worthy

As you walk away,
I rise to my feet
  begin to dance
  begin to sing
Anything you might
want to hear

Still, you walk faster
  begin to beg
  begin to scream
Just a bit of praise
for the insecure

You turn around
you face me down
  begin to laugh
  begin to jeer

The whole street joins in
  I back down
  turn away
  run and hide

Well, anyway,
that's why I didn't share
my idea
