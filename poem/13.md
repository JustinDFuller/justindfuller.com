```
What is justice
but the good
of the weaker?

Can you imagine
a king crying for justice?

Can you imagine
a ruler complaining of oppression?

Only the powerless
can beg for justice
Only the powerful
can give it

But if the powerless
can sway a ruler
are they powerless?

If the oppressed
can move their king
are they oppressed?

Justice comes
from the powerful
when they think
of the weak

Injustice,
when they think
of themselves
