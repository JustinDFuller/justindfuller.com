# The Philosophy of Lovers

# I

Raemi sat on his favorite stone at the edge of the garden that surrounded the market. Before him huddled a group of a dozen women with their children and bored teenagers who were looking for something to do. Scanning the group, he asked, "Who wants to try today's question first?"

Behind him, the garden that ran along the outer wall of the market was filled with exotic plants, bushes, and trees that traders brought as gifts to the town. This particular section had tall, leafy trees with fat, spiky trunks. It was surrounded with large stones, and filled with tall, light green grass that bowed to the breeze.

Raemi liked to sit outside the market. A large, wooden structure, inside it was a courtyard that extended the length of several longships. The actual building was nothing but a wall with some overhanging to provide a bit of shade and shelter from the sun and rain. There were several entrances, merely large square holes where no wood was placed, tall enough for a trader’s wagon to pass through. Raemi could see one entrance to the left of where he sat. The market was always the busiest part of the town, but sitting outside afforded a bit more space and quiet, so one could actually have a conversation.

The road to the market was wide and paved with beautiful, mostly flat, tan and red stones. It was mainly filled with two types of people. The first, the kind that never stopped, came from the left, they were the women and men coming from the open road or the docks. They were pulling carts loaded from the fishing boats, full of king mackerel and grouper; there were also farmers, blacksmiths, tanners, and, occasionally, a trader’s wagon packed with the fruits of their trades throughout the region. They walked determinedly, without ever looking down to notice Raemi.

The other kind came from Raemi’s right, inland, where the greater part of the town sat. They were mainly women and their children heading to the market to purchase supplies. Fish for dinner, thread to sew clothes. With them, often reluctantly, came Raemi’s favorites. The teenagers who had finished the morning’s work helping out on their family’s fishing boat or farm.

Today, as with most days, it still pleasantly surprised Raemi when it was one of these that shot up his hand to answer the question. “I’ll give it a try,” he said. The boy had to be at least thirteen, with long, wavy black hair and the first signs of fuzz on his face. He was standing at the back of the group. Even though Raemi was sitting, he could tell that this boy would already be as tall as him.

“What’s your name?”

“I’m Aviit.”

“How old are you Aviit?”

“Fifteen.”

“Well, Aviit, please, come closer and sit down next to me. If you answer my question, even if you get it wrong, I’ll share some bread with you and your family. Please, everyone, let him through.”

As Aviit stepped carefully over the crossed legs of mothers and children, Raemi noticed the state of Aviit’s clothes. He had clearly tried to mend them, but they were still fraying, dirty, and apparently made from several fabrics stitched together. There was also no apparent mother, sibling, or even friend accompanying him.

Raemi’s bread and questions gathered all sorts of people. From the look on some of the older faces in the crowd, he could tell that not everyone felt this was a positive quality. But, for the last two years, this is what he always did. Each morning, he woke with the sun rising through the semi-circle shaped window. He rose from his small cot that consisted only of a simple mat on the hard, stone floor – topped with a thin woolen sheet – and tiredly shuffled to the monastery’s kitchen to begin baking. His recipe was simple, and although he never sold a single loaf, he was known for having some of the best bread in town.

“Here is today’s question. Can you explain why the river Mand flows only in one direction, towards the sea?”

Now came Raemi’s favorite part, how would his subject react? Sometimes the question met a blank stare of confusion, occasionally anger at the difficulty. Today, however, he was delighted to see Aviit’s grin. Perhaps more impressively, he did not attempt to answer right away. Instead, he pushed himself back onto his feet and turned around. While there was a beautiful garden and market behind Raemi, in front of him, the river Mand flowed lazily into the sea. Along much of the path the flat paving stones ran up against a low stone wall to block a sheer drop to the river. Occasionally, where there was less of a drop into the river, there was no wall, and instead you could walk out onto a small, rocky beach. Aviit studied the river for a few moments, first looking left at the sea, then slowly moving his gaze to the right, inward, toward the town, and eventually, up, to the mountains.

After a few moments, Aviit turned back. When their eyes met, Raemi noticed just how tired he looked. Aviit asked, “Where does the river come from? From here, it looks like it comes from the mountains, but I’ve never been that far.”

Answering the question with another question. Raemi was honestly surprised, as this almost never happened. Possibly, this boy was uncommonly bright. He made a mental note to invite him to the monastery for lessons. Most of the townsfolk gave a guess, or repeated some tale about the gods or magic.

“It does,” Raemi said, “I’ve been there myself. I took a bath in a freezing pool near the top. There’s a road used by the merchants that follows the river to the mountain. On the other side of the mountain there are a few smaller towns that they travel to after visiting our port. Eventually, the road diverges but you can keep following the river through the forest. It’s not an easy climb, but as far as I know there are few dangerous animals to worry about. As you follow it, many streams join along the way, and the river gradually gets smaller and smaller, until you’re following only a tiny stream. Eventually, it simply disappears. It was before that point, though, that I found something resembling a large tub in the ground. The water was so clear that you could see straight to the bottom. It was freezing, but it was a summer day and I had been hiking for hours, so it felt wonderful. I felt like a prince, bathing in the palace.”

“Did you go alone?” Aviit asks.

More questions. Impressive. Raemi thinks for a few moments, enjoying the silence between himself, Aviit, and the crowd. “No.” He answers, with no further explanation. 

Aviit watches him for a moment, probably wondering if Raemi would explain more. When he does not, Aviit asks yet another question, “Have you ever played marbles?”

“Yes,” Raemi replies, “why?”

“Sometimes I play with the other kids. They aren’t really marbles, just smooth stones that we gather from the beaches, but they work well enough. Whenever someone overshoots a marble, it always rolls farther if they are shooting toward the sea. If they are shooting at the mountain, it stops quickly—even when it doesn’t hit anything.” Aviit pauses.

“Does the sea pull everything to it?” he finally answers. “Maybe it’s even trying to pull us to it right now.”
