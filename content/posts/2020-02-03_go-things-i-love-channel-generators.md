In my last post, [Channels and Goroutines](/2020/01/go-things-i-love-channels-and-goroutines/), I discussed how channels can be used to safely write concurrent programs. It showed that channels and goroutines can be combined to use communication instead of shared memory. Now, I want to take that discussion further by looking at how code can organize, create, and share goroutines and channels.

## Starting Synchronous

To explore these concepts, I want to start small and build up to the fully concurrent version. In this way, we will clearly see the decisions that led from synchronous to concurrent code.

The example scenario is a common one: user creation. Really, it could be substitued for any entity creation. However, I want to show it in the context of a more fully-functioning production application. This means that, instead of just creating the user in the database, there will be some analytics data saved and a new user email will be scheduled; there will also be some error handling.

Here's the initial snippet.

```go
func (service *Service) CreateUser(user *User) error {
	err := service.AnalyticsClient.Put(AnalyticsTypeUserSignup, AnalyticsStateUserSignupStarted, user.Email)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	err = service.DatabaseClient.Put(DatabaseTableUsers, user.Email, user)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	err = service.EventScheduler.Schedule(EmailTemplateNewUserSignup, user.Email, user)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

	return nil
}
```

[See it in the Go Playground.](https://play.golang.org/p/v2QKP3Q1bIC)

Hopefully this code looks like something you could imagine seeing in a user registration service. It does some straightforward work. First, it saves analytics data and the new user to the database, then it schedules a new user welcome email.

So, what's the problem?

Well, in our imaginary scenario, this particular registration endpoint is used because the shopping cart checkout forces users to create an account. The route used to respond very quickly, before we started collecting analytics and sending the emails. Now it responds several hundred milliseconds slower, [significantly lowering the conversion rate](https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales).

Let's speed it up.

## Add a little concurrency

The dead-simplest way to achieve concurrency is with a waitgroup. We can keep all the original code, wrap the execution in a [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression), and launch each part as a goroutine. Take a look.

```go
func (service *Service) CreateUser(user *User) error {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	var userError error

	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		err := service.AnalyticsClient.Put(AnalyticsTypeUserSignup, AnalyticsStateUserSignupStarted, user.Email)
		if err != nil {
			userError = err
		}
	}()

	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		err := service.DatabaseClient.Put(DatabaseTableUsers, user.Email, user)
		if err != nil {
			userError = err
		}
	}()

	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		err := service.EventScheduler.Schedule(EmailTemplateNewUserSignup, user.Email, user)
		if err != nil {
			userError = err
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()

	return userError
}
```

[See it in the Go Playground.](https://play.golang.org/p/BgLqfb2d_pm)

A few things just happened. Yes, the snippet got longer, but it now runs in less than half the time! If you opened it up in the playground you saw that the program now runs in just 300ms. That's less than half of the last version, which clocked in at about 700ms. If we stopped here our conversion rate would go back to normal and everyone would be happy.

Well, maybe not everyone. What happens when an error occurs? Does this method fail-fast and quickly get an error response to the user? What about the memory sharing? Each goroutine is modifying `userError`, that can't be the best way to do it, right?

## What happens when there is an error

Up until this point the code for `AnalyticsClient`, `DatabaseClient`, and `EventScheduler` has not been shown (unless you opened up the go playground). Unsurprisingly, the methods on these structs are only example code; they print the arguments, sleep the goroutine, then return `nil` or an error.

To show what happens when an error occurs, one of the methods can be altered to return an error instead of `nil`.

```go
func (ac *DatabaseClient) Put(table, key string, data interface{}) error {
	fmt.Printf("Saving database data to table %s with key %s. \n", table, key)
	time.Sleep(time.Duration(200) * time.Millisecond)
	return errors.New("Oops, we could have stopped after 200ms")
}
```

Instead of returning as soon as an error occurs, the error group waits for all goroutines to complete.

```
Scheduling event for email NewUserSignupEmail with key johnny@example.com. 
Saving analytics data to table AttemptedUserSignups with key johnny@example.com. 
Saving database data to table Users with key johnny@example.com. 
Oops, we could have stopped after 200ms
Took 300ms
```

// This example shows the problems with the waitgroup errors
// They do not fail fast, it still takes 300ms even though an
// error happens after 200ms.

https://play.golang.org/p/TKq6O13StDP

// This example shows using a sync.ErrorGroup
// Unfortunately, it still waits for the whole WaitGroup
// to complete, because under the hood it uses a regular 
// wait group.
// And also, in my opinion, it still has many, subjectively,
// ugly anonymous functions.

https://play.golang.org/p/4ByVdSlxtWP

// This example shows using channel generators
// It stops after 200ms, but it has a manual cleanup
// with a for loop, select, and a manual counter
// This is very complex

https://play.golang.org/p/aHXBOpGLpHs

// This example shows methods that accept an error channel
// This is a bit less complex because there are less methods
// and less cleanup. Also less channels.
// Unfortunately, it's not very realistic that
// everything can happen concurrently.

https://play.golang.org/p/RZjAYOUXtgo

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.

https://play.golang.org/p/pKVDktQWCO0

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now channel-generators have been added to allow
// Some of the processes to run concurrently.
// Unfortunately, it doesn't fail fast on errors.

https://play.golang.org/p/3F-xnztMhxj

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now we are waiting for whichever channel returns first
// So on an error it will fail fast

https://play.golang.org/p/_LmnjayYw19

// Here's a more complex use-case that doesn't assume
// all calls can go out at once.
// Now it has channel generators and no errors

https://play.golang.org/p/ZkAUyCUCyQx

Things I want to talk about:
* Go's first-class support of channels in select statements and for loops.
* Read and write-only channels
* Channel generators
* Ordering channel responses
  * Unordered responses: https://play.golang.org/p/p_3YPw9LrgC
  * Ordered responses: https://play.golang.org/p/EkYf-YSsErW
