<span class="story">

The story I have to tell you today is not the story I wished to tell. In fact, I am loath to repeat much of it. I pray antiquity and modernity alike judge me not as an author, nor even as editor, but as a trembling witness. Reluctant to confess what he has seen, yet compelled by his conscience to reveal the devilry that took place at the autumn equinox on the outskirts of a great Carolina wilderness.

## I

Whether it benefit you or not, reader, I must explain what innocent circumstances brought me upon this mystery. I cannot countenance anyone to think I would search out such thought or deed. If I had known what would occur, I would have fled those ancient and crooked pines.

My ill-fated venture began six days before the equinox when my local chapter of ornithology began circulating reports that were of the utmost interest to me. Locals of a certain mountain town were reporting signs of both Dryocopus Pileatus and Alcedinidae. Both rare species that I have long sought to observe. Upon hearing these rumors, and admittedly without ascertaining their veracity, I promptly notified my employer of my immediate absence until the following week. Securing a little cash and transportation, of which my benefactor surely would have rejected had she known the bedeviled thoughts her charity would unleash upon the world, I set out to find lodging near the reported sightings.

Half a day later I drove through the foggy conifers into a town near the fabled Clingmans Dome. Upon entering the town, the eldritch forest–as I would later come to think of it–cleared. In its place stood several dozen houses, a postal office, as well as a grocers and general store. It was evident none of this construction was from the current century, bespeaking the simpler architecture of another time. 

Despite my conspicuous arrival in a town that, as I took it, saw few visitors, I was warmly welcomed by a man exiting the post office with a small brown package. Since I had not been sure where to go, I was driving slowly with my window rolled down. After a moment of obvious confusion, he adjusted his demeanor and hailed me to pull the old station wagon onto a dirt patch in front of the ancient building. After a brief introduction I declared my intention and my credentials, the latter of which he seemed to take no notice of, whereby he directed me to the only person in town who might possibly have any interest in communicating with ornithologists. Rather, I should say, he directed me several miles out of town, to a small estate known to belong to an eccentric writer and discredited scientist.

If only I could have known what that fateful advice would bring about, I could have thanked the man, turned around my mother’s old station wagon, and driven back east. As it stands, I was overcome with no such foresight and set out in earnest search of my host. 

Despite the distance of only a few miles, it took several hours to find my destination. The roads at this point were merely dirt and gravel, if that. On one occasion I became so tired of driving that I pulled the car over to what one might call the side of the road. Fetching my binoculars, pencils, and notebook, I attempted to find some recuperation in my profession. Unfortunately, there was nothing in sight except common Mimus Polyglottos. However, I knew that a bit of rest would do wonders for my aching legs, so I resigned myself to illustrating the diving form of these common and brilliant creatures.

Once complete, I found my feet and legs rejuvenated and ready to continue the journey. It also reminded me of the simple beauty that I often overlook in everyday things. One with my experience and reputation might not incline to focus on something so familiar as Mimus Polyglottos, but the exercise revealed several things about the creatures I never before noticed. I took a note to publish a few thoughts about this in the university’s publication upon my return; a thought that would soon cease to be of any importance.

I arrived at my unexpecting host just as the sun fell below the trees. Finding the property surprisingly without a gate and unprotected by hounds, I parked a reasonable distance away. If the recluse should warn me off with a shotgun I would be safe, but if he watched my approach, he would hopefully see my friendly and hopeful demeanor. Just to be safe, I gave the horn a few taps and shouted a greeting.

Despite the unusual hour for callers and my unexpected visit, my host opened his door, greeting me with warranted apprehension, but without aggression. My assumption about a mountain recluse led me to expect a gruff and standoffish eccentric; I quickly realized my mistake. The gentleman who greeted me was of similar age and stature as myself. He was well-groomed and his manner of dress was oddly formal for the setting. I, without forsaking the safety of my vehicle, while he remained within a calculated distance of the door, began to explain this abnormal visit.

“Hello, I am calling after a doctor Miles Thales. Might that be you?”

Allow me to assure you: I was equally surprised at the following events as you will surely be. To be perfectly forthcoming, I had spent the drive fortifying my mind to the possibility that I would sleep the night in the cold back seat of this station wagon. Instead, and to my great delight, I was, within a few minutes, reclining in a comfortable chair by a low-crackling fireplace. A steaming cup of tea placed in my hands by a host that shew no signs of reclusivity nor eccentricism. Indeed, all evidence pointed to the contrary. The room I found myself in was undoubtedly equipped for entertaining. Furnished with comfortable arm chairs and even a <i>fauteuil</i>, encircling a warm fireplace, there was no doubt that I sat in a gathering space. But for what mysterious or scholarly pursuits, I could not say.

Across the fireplace sat my host. The young doctor Thales. Not a disheveled old man but well-groomed and young. He was certainly not a recluse, but was in fact positively excited to have a visitor.

“It’s certainly odd these reports would lead you here. I haven’t communicated with a university colleague in at least three years. However, I don’t expect you’ll find your journey was in vain.”

“What do you mean?” I asked, renewing hope that the elusive species I sought did indeed nestle in this quiet forest.

“Well, I admit I don’t know of the creatures you’re seeking. But there are many excellent foot trails beyond this property. I cannot quite describe the sensations, but I often feel that, when I walk through these trees, they speak to me. You said you have a few days, yes? So I entreat you, stay a while, and see what comes of it.”

I woke in the night to the reverberant melody of the majestic Bubo Virginianus. Not another sound was to be heard. But, I must admit, despite the hospitable manner of my reception, I crept to my bedroom door, ensuring the lock was still securely fastened.
