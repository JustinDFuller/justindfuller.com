Every line of code that you write is the culmination of your professional and educational experience; be it a formal college education, an intense six-week bootcamp, or a prodigious number of blog posts and tutorials, your well of experience is drawn from by every line of code, every decision you make as a software developer. That's why it's essential that you spend your precious, limited free time—the fragment that you use to better yourself through learning—with the best possible resources.

Unfortunately, not all learning resources are equal. While there are great resources of every type, we've all read the blog posts that were seemingly thrown together in five minutes, scattered books with little-to-no coherence, and tutorials that created more questions than were answered. 

In this series, _The Book Review_, I plan to recommend, summarize, and review some of the best software development learning resources that I've found. I also hope to convince you that software development books are worth more of your time than you might have thought; that—contrary to popular belief—software isn't moving too fast for books to keep up, because some wisdom is timeless.

## Is it worth the time?

The major drawback to reading a book is also the greatest benefit to reading a book: the time involved. As I mentioned earlier, it's possible to create a blog post in five minutes, or a youtube tutorial in an hour; the same cannot be said for a book. Yes, some are not worth your time — that's why I'm beginning this list, to recommend the best ones I have found. However, books are more likely to have quality instructions and principles because of the time required to create one. There are also many review steps involved in the publishing of a book; reviews and reviewers mean mistakes are caught and flakey ideas are challenged before it's ever sent to the masses.

This type of rigor is completely unecessary for many aspects of software development. As an example, I don't need to have a Reactjs component question peer reviewed before explaining which order the lifecycle methods are invoked. Instead, when I start to think on a larger level, such as system design, team cohesion, refactoring, algorithms, and concurrency, I want to be sure that I am learning from the very best works, and I want an in-depth discussion.

For that reason, you wont find any books on this list related to a specific programming language, library, or framework. Instead, you'll find books that focus on larger — often, more abstract — problems.

* Is it worth the time?
  * Timeless wisdom
  * Look at the programming paradigms from Clean Architecture
* When to use books and when to not.
  * When: Principles, fundamentals, generics
  * Not: Modern languages, frameworks, libraries, tools
* How to find time
  * During your commute (bus, train)
  * Take short breaks if you are having trouble being productive
  * Carve out 15 minutes each day (to start)
* What books will and won't be included?
  * Not strictly software development/coding. Some management and software team books (Making of a manager, peopleware)
* The list of books (put into alpha order)
  * Peopleware
  * Robert Martin's Clean series
  * Refactoring
  * The making of a manager
  * Design Patterns
