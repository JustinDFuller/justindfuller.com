Nothing wasn't quite what I expected it to be. I think I expected emptiness; nothing is a little different that empty. In order for there to be nothing there can't even be me.

Instead, I was alive one moment, then nothing.

## Awake

My back is cold and a little damp, there's a light above me that I can't quite make out, and the noises are both deafening and hardly audible.

There's a slight ringing in my ears that sounds like it's going away.
