In [Theaetetus](https://amzn.to/3BfyJTl), Socrates attempts to reason about a fundamental question 
of philosophy: What is knowledge?

In part of the work, Socrates addresses Protagoras' claim that, "Man is the measure of all things"
and, "What seems to a man, is to him." Meaning, knowledge is relative to each person.

<!--more-->

This claim was fundamentally at odds with Plato, the author of Theaetetus, and his view of the world.
To Plato, there must be a truth independent of any man, by which all other claims can be measured.

However, after he rebuts Protagoras' statement with a convincing-sounding argument,
he does something quite unexpected, at least to this modern reader.

He begins praising the very person he seeks to discredit:

> Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are. <br />
> And if he could only just get his head out of the world below, <br />
> he would have overthrown both of us agian and again, <br />
> me for talking nonsense and you for assenting to me <br />

He not only claims his opponent to be wiser than himself, but also that he would
successfully rebut him, if only he was alive.

But, of course, this isn't the only time Socrates says something like this.
In [Plato's Republic](https://amzn.to/3PFdHSQ) as Socrates attempts to define the perfect state,
he says:

> Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves? <br />
> In this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.

He pauses in his argument to give voice to a strong counter-argument of his would-be opponents.

But he doesn't stop there, after rebutting that argument, he moves to a more difficult counter-argument,
one that he describes as:

> but a greater [rebuttal] is coming; you will not think much of this when you see the next.

He doesn't address only the weak counter arguments, but the best he can think of. Not only that,
he builds up the counter-arguments merits instead of trying to discredit them.

Now, contrast this to the style of argument you've experienced. Here I'm referring to the political
arguments of the thanksgiving table, the heated discussions at work as you try to figure out
the best path forward. When have you heard someone pause to argue _for_ someone on the other side?

No, instead we focus solely on disputing the other argument. Often, we rely on the [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)
argument to cut down the weakest forms of our opponents arguments. But, of course, this isn't the only option.
Instead of strawmanning, you can [Steel Man](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man). In other words, you can argue
against your opponent's strongest arguments, instead of the weakest. But why stop there? You can take it even further
by [Starmanning](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/how-to-star-man-arguing-from-compassion/), choosing both the strongest
counter-argument while also building up your opponent.

It turns out, Socrates also addresses this issue long ago.

> After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency

Here he contrasts disputers, also called Eristics, against philosophers. One group is merely attempting
to win an argument, to come up with some phrase that no one else can dispute. They aren't interested in
the truth, they are interested in winning.

But, instead, a philosopher is chasing after the truth, and that's what Socrates is doing. 
That's why he argues against himself.

I think we should argue against ourselves too. 

But that's dangerous, because you might be taken advantage of. The moment you begin arguing for the other side,
your opponent could begin to claim victory. Even if they don't, you run the risk of accidentally convincing
listeners of a point you don't actually disagree with. This might be trivial at work, when negotiating how
best to implement some small software project, or it could be consequential, discussing important moral issues
with friends or family.
