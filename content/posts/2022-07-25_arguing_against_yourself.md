In the book [Theaetetus](https://amzn.to/3BfyJTl), Socrates attempts to reason about a fundamental question 
of philosophy: What is knowledge?

Socrates addresses the idea of another philosopher, Protagoras, that claims, "Man is the measure of all things"
and, "What seems to a man, is to him." Meaning, knowledge is relative to each person.

<!--more-->

This claim was fundamentally at odds with Plato, the author of Theaetetus, and his view of the world.
To Plato, there must be a truth independent of any man, by which all other claims can be measured.

However, after he rebuts Protagoras' statement with a convincing argument,
he does something quite unexpected, at least to this modern reader.

He begins praising the very person he seeks to discredit:

> Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are. <br />
> And if he could only just get his head out of the world below, <br />
> he would have overthrown both of us again and again, <br />
> me for talking nonsense and you for assenting to me <br />

He not only claims his opponent to be wiser than himself, but also that he would
successfully rebut him, if only he was alive.

But, of course, this isn't the only time Socrates says something like this.
In [Plato's Republic](https://amzn.to/3PFdHSQ) as Socrates attempts to define the perfect state,
he says:

> Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves? <br />
> In this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.

He pauses in his argument to give voice to a strong counter-argument of his would-be opponents.

But he doesn't stop there, after rebutting that argument, he moves to a more difficult counter-argument,
saying:

> A greater [rebuttal] is coming; you will not think much of this when you see the next.

He doesn't address only the weak counter arguments, but the best he can think of. Not only that,
he builds up the counter-arguments merits instead of trying to discredit them.

Now, contrast this to the style of argument you've experienced. Here I'm referring to the political
arguments of the thanksgiving table, the heated discussions at work as you try to figure out
the best path forward. When have you heard someone pause to argue _for_ someone on the other side?

No, instead we focus solely on disputing the other argument. Often, we rely on the [Straw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)
argument to cut down the weakest forms of our opponents arguments. But, of course, this isn't the only option.
Instead of strawmanning, you can [Steel Man](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man). In other words, you can argue
against your opponent's strongest arguments, instead of the weakest. But why stop there? You can take it even further
with the [Star Man](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/how-to-star-man-arguing-from-compassion/), choosing both the strongest counter-argument while also building up your opponent.  

## Old Ideas

It turns out, Socrates also addresses this issue long ago.  

> After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency 

Here he contrasts disputers, also called Eristics, against philosophers. 
One group is merely attempting to win an argument, to come up with some phrase that no one else can dispute. 
They aren't interested in the truth, they are interested in winning.  

Instead, a philosopher is chasing after the truth, and that's what Socrates is doing.  
That's why he argues against himself.  

I think we should argue against ourselves too.  

But that's dangerous, because you might be taken advantage of. 
The moment you begin arguing for the other side, your opponent could begin to claim victory. 
Even if they don't, you run the risk of accidentally convincing listeners of a point you actually disagree with. 
This might be trivial at work, when negotiating how best to implement some small software project, 
or it could be consequential, discussing important moral issues with friends or family.

So, there better be a good tradeoff to make it worth the cost and effort.
Thankfully, the benefit to arguing against yourself are many, but they can only be realized
after you've established the right goal.

## Benefits

If your goal is to win the argument, I admit this is the wrong approach. <br />
If your goal is to find the truth, you'll find the benefits.

First, as you switch your goal to finding the truth, you should also drop the view
that you're talking to an opponent. Instead, as cheesy as it may sound, think of them as a partner in the search for truth.
Even if you know they don't take that point of view, it will help you lower your defenses.
Suddenly, the argument is less tense, because you're searching for the truth with a partner
instead of fighting your opponent.

Next, you'll better understand your partner's views.
If you've heard or experienced [Cunningham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#%22Cunningham's_Law%22)
you know what I mean. As soon as you misrepresent their view, they'll call you out.
This has happened to me many times (I'm pretty bad at understanding people, it seems). 
I'll rephrase someone's argument or attempt to build upon it, only to hear emphatically, "no, that's not what I'm saying at all!"
If I hadn't done this, I would have inadvertendly argued against a Straw Man. 
If not a Straw Man, I would have at least been arguing against a totally different point of view.

Once you can restate and add upon their view, you'll also begin to discover some shared values and concerns. 
These can quickly become common ground that you build upon to find the answer.

With that common ground, you'll also give yourself credit in your partner's eyes.
To them, you'll also no longer be an opponent, simplying trying to dispute their idea.
You've become a partner who understands their view and shares their concerns.

With that shared foundation, you can seek the truth together.

## Disputers

Unless, of course, you're talking with a disputer.

Let's assume for a moment that you decided not to be one.
You are truly arguing, discussing, in good-faith; in search of the truth.

There's no need to fear, because all is not lost.

There's a strategy
