In 2011, researchers at Ben Gurion University in Israel and Columbia University found that [Judge’s rulings are affected by their lunch breaks](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1018033108). At the beginning of the day, the judges granted 65% of parole requests. The rate declined steadily until a lunch break, after which the rate jumped back to 65%. Almost no requests were granted at the end of the day.

One of the authors, Jonathan Levav, says that the judges may have been grumpy from hunger, but they could also be experiencing mental fatigue. 

This study got me thinking about a similar situation where I’m required to judge others. As an engineer who is part of the interview rotation at The New York Times ([check out our careers](https://www.nytco.com/careers/)), I must constantly judge others' skills and experience.

Am I more likely to fail an interviewee at the end of my day? Am I more likely to pass an interview shortly after my lunch break?

Here are a few ideas to reduce bias, focused on things that I can control at my level: an individual not in charge of the hiring process.

## Consistent Time
One simple solution is to conduct interviews at consistent times. For the most part, I do all my interviews between 1-4pm eastern time. I don’t generally offer availability outside of this window. Certainly, 3pm is a few hours after my lunch break (12pm-1pm) compared to a 1pm interview. But I think it’s a necessary window to give to be flexible to interviewees.

This isn’t a perfect solution, because some interviewees simply can’t make this window work. But, for the most part, it works well.

## Consistent Questions
Another way to avoid bias is to have a consistent set of questions that I judge interviewees against. 

These questions are not absolute, where 5 out of 5 equals a hire recommendation and 2 out of 5 results in a rejection recommendation. Instead, the scores are judged relative to other interviewees in the pipeline. If most interviews are scoring 2 out of 5, and someone comes in with a 4 out of 5, they should likely get a recommendation. 

Your experience may vary with this, and you’ll certainly want to avoid a race to the bottom, where you accept candidates that don’t meet your standards, just because it’s taking a while to find the right candidate.

### Example Questions

For coding interviews, I might use a set of questions like this:

* Did they ask clarifying questions about the problem?
* Does the code compile?
* Did they add or describe tests that consider edge cases?
* Are they able to describe the algorithmic complexity of the solution?
* Were they able to use language concepts such as structs, maps, or arrays?

For a full stack system design interview, the questions might look like this:

* Did they ask clarifying questions about the problem?
* Did they describe the API according to a consistent standard such as REST or GraphQL?
* Were they able to justify their choices with a technical reason? (Not, it’s what I always use)
* Were they familiar with SEO, security, and accessibility?
* Were they able to describe a clear component structure?

These questions certainly aren’t perfect. However, they should be better than going by my “gut” feeling, which will be affected by things like hunger, how difficult my day has been, or even how nice the candidate’s zoom background is.
