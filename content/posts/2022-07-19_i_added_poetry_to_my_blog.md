**TL;DR:** You can see it [here](/tags/poetry).

I'm not using this as an opportunity to claim poetic greateness, but
to share a fulfilling outlet that I found in a difficult time.

<!--more-->

I write this in the midst of a difficult time mentally.

From the outside, as it usually goes, things appear well. I have a good job, a wonderful family,
great friends, hobbies, a nice house, two cars, plenty of money, and little debt.

Yet, to be honest, like many others, I'm struggling mentally.

* Living during a pandemic is horrible
* Parenting is extremely stressful
* Living in the suburbs is monotonous
* Working 9-5 (even though I love my job) leaves me wishing for more out of life

This all feels so stupid to complain about, because so many others have worse problems.
But, nonetheless, here I am struggling, and it doesn't do anyone any good to pretend I'm not.

But what's this got to do with anyone else?

Well, there's another compounding problem, that some of you may be familiar with: 

    I'm quite bad at talking about my feelings.

Of course, this leads to being bottled up. I needed an outlet.

Hence, the poetry.

I find it allows me to say certain things, often without directly saying them.
It gives me a chance to share my feelings in my own way, on my own terms.

I typically start by physically writing, only later copying the content to my blog.
I went ahead and invested in a decent notebook and pen (nothing too expensive) to bring a bit more joy to the process.

Some other outlets that I've found enjoyable lately:
* Nature photography, which I also plan to add here soon.
* Reading, I particularly enjoyed [Nasty, Brutish, and Short](https://amzn.to/3ceRMmm) on Philosophy with kids.
* Coding projects like [Really Simple Notes](https://www.reallysimplenotes.com)

I hope you enjoy it and I hope everyone else out there struggling can find a helpful outlet.

PS. I'll take this opportunity to call out some other important things that I'm trying to work on too: getting better sleep, eating healthier, drinking less coffee, exercising more, finding proper medication, and going to therapy.
