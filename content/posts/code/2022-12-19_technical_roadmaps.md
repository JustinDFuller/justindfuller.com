Your team may maintain a product roadmap, but do you have a technical roadmap?

If not, you should. 

Here's what it is and why you should have one.

## What is it?

A product roadmap defines the changes your team plans to make to your product. 
In my experience, a product roadmap focuses almost exclusively on new features.
Occasionally bug fixes and improvements make their way into a product roadmap.
Only rarely do purely technical needs make their way into the roadmap.

This last case, purely technical needs, seem to only make their way into the roadmap
when the problems they cause become so bad that they negatively affect the product roadmap.
