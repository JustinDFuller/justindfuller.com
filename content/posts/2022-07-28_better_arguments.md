In the book [Theaetetus](https://amzn.to/3BfyJTl), Socrates attempts to reason about a fundamental question 
of philosophy: What is knowledge?

Socrates addresses the idea of another philosopher, Protagoras, who claims, "Man is the measure of all things"
and, "What seems to a man, is to him." Meaning knowledge is relative to each person.

<!--more-->

Plato, the author of Theaetetus, was fundamentally at odds with this idea.
To Plato, there must be a truth independent of any man, by which all other claims can be measured.

However, after convincingly rebutting Protagoras' claim,
Socrates begins praising the very person he seeks to discredit:

> Doubtless, as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are. <br />
> And if he could only just get his head out of the world below, <br />
> he would have overthrown both of us again and again, <br />
> me for talking nonsense and you for assenting to me <br />

He claims his opponent is wiser and would successfully rebut him, if he was still alive.

This isn't the only time Socrates says something like this. It's something of a pattern,
even a strategy, that he employs.

In [Plato's Republic](https://amzn.to/3PFdHSQ) as Socrates attempts to define the perfect state,
he says:

> Shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves? <br />
> In this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.

He pauses in his argument to give voice to a strong counter-argument of his would-be opponents.

But he doesn't stop there, after rebutting that argument, he moves to a more difficult counter-argument,
saying:

> A greater [rebuttal] is coming; you will not think much of this when you see the next.

He doesn't address only the weak counter arguments, but the best he can think of. Not only that,
he builds up the counter-arguments merits instead of trying to discredit them.

The question is, why would he argue against himself? Why would he build the credibility of his opponent?

In Theaetetus, he addresses this question head-on.

> After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency 

Here he contrasts disputers, also called Eristics, against philosophers. 
One group is merely attempting to win an argument, to come up with some phrase that no one else can dispute. 
They aren't interested in the truth, they are interested in winning.  

Instead, a philosopher is chasing after the truth, and that's what Socrates is doing.  

That's why he argues against himself.  

He's not afraid of the truth, he's afraid of being wrong. So he assumes the best of whoever contradics him,
he assumes there's a good reason that they disagree, if only he could discover it.

But this isn't how I've learned to argue.

No, instead I focus solely on disputing the other argument. Often, I rely on the [Straw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man)
argument to cut down the weakest forms of my opponent's argument. 

But, of course, this isn't the only option.

Instead of strawmanning, I could [Steel Man](https://constantrenewal.com/steel-man). In other words, I could argue
against my opponent's strongest arguments, instead of the weakest. But why stop there? I could take it even further
with the [Star Man](https://centerforinquiry.org/blog/how-to-star-man-arguing-from-compassion/), choosing both the strongest 
counter-argument while also building up my opponent.  

Actually, I'm suggesting to take it even further. Yes, I should build up my opponent's credibility; yes,
I should argue against their strongest arguments; now I go even further: I should argue against myself.

That's dangerous, because the moment I begin arguing for the other side, my opponent could claim victory. 
Even if they don't, I risk convincing listeners of a point I disagree with. 
This might be trivial at work, negotiating how to implement some software project;
it could be consequential, discussing moral issues with friends or family.

So, what makes it worth the cost and effort?

Like Socrates, it begins by establishing the correct goal.
If the goal is to win the argument, I admit this is the wrong approach.
If the goal is to find the truth, there are many benefits.

First, as I switch goals to finding the truth, I can drop the view that I'm talking to an opponent. 
Instead, as cheesy as it may sound, I can think of them as a partner in the search for truth.
This framing lowers my defenses even when I know my partner doesn't share my goal, .

Suddenly, the argument is less tense, because I'm searching for the truth with a partner instead of fighting an opponent.

Next, I gain empathy and understanding for my partner's views.
Because, in order to argue for another's view, I typically have to _express_ their view.
If you've heard or experienced [Cunningham's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#%22Cunningham's_Law%22),
you know what I mean. As soon I misrepresent their view, they'll call me out.
This has happened to me many times (I'm pretty bad at understanding people, it seems). 
I'll rephrase someone's argument or attempt to build upon it, only to hear emphatically, "no, that's not what I'm saying at all."
If I hadn't attempted to rephrase their view, I would have inadvertendly argued against a Straw Man. 

Once you can restate and add upon their view, you'll also begin to discover some shared values and concerns. 
These can quickly become common ground that you build upon to find the answer.

With that common ground, you'll also give yourself credit in your partner's eyes.
To them, you'll also no longer be an opponent, simplying trying to dispute their idea.
You've become a partner who understands their view and shares their concerns.

With that shared foundation, you can seek the truth together.

## Disputers

Unless, of course, you're talking with a disputer.

Let's assume for a moment that you decided not to be one.
You are truly arguing, discussing, in good-faith; in search of the truth.
But your partner? Not so much. They want to *win*.

There's no need to fear, because all is not lost.

There's a strategy I refer to as **Granting the Premise**, which can allow you
to have a productive conversation with someone who is otherwise difficult, or working off of very
different assumptions than yourself.

Imagine you're at the Thanksgiving dinner table when your uncle claims that the recent
election was stolen. Millions of fake votes were cast. There needs to be a recount, even a revote.

What's your immediate reaction?

If you're like me, you'll begin to debate his premise.

No, the election was not stolen. Where is the evidence? And so on.

You might pull up articles, reputable sources of information, and prove without a doubt (at least, you have no doubts)
that the election was not in fact stolen.

A good-faith arguer would likely say, "thanks for bringing this to my attention".
They would then take into account your new evidence, go back and compare it to what they heard before,
and perhaps even seek out more sources so that they can understand the truth.

That happens all the time, right?

No, instead they begin to spew their own facts, and we all begin to attack the credibility
of each other's sources. The conversation is altogether unproductive, and no one leaves with their view changed.

Instead, we can grant the premise. As scary as it may sound, you can say something like,
"let's assume for a moment that the election was stolen" and begin to try to understand if their
conclusion logically follows from their premise.

In our Thanksgiving dinner case, we might ask, why would a do-over help? Won't the election still be
vulnerable to tampering? Could it be more vulnerable since there's less time to prepare?
What other options do we have, besides redoing the election?

The point is, you are no longer trying dispute their initial claim. This is particularly helpful
in cases where the initial claim was never based on hard facts or evidence, but was instead chosen
because of feelings. In these situations, no amount of evidence or counterargument is going to help.

However, when you grant their premise, you can find out if their conclusion logically follows their
initial claim. This can lead to an actual change in views, by showing that even with their initial claim,
their conclusion doesn't make sense.

Or, on the flip side, you may discover that their argument has more merit than you thought.

It could also lead to questions that neither of you thought of before. In the election example, maybe
you both begin to wonder why you even need to ask these questions about our elections? How could we
create a system with more transparency, one that everyone could trust?
