```
I have so many questions
  is it my super power
  or curse?

I have so many questions
  no answers

Always questions,
  never when it matters

Plenty of questions,
  nothing interesting to say

Full of questions
  looking for the laughter
  maybe some joy, too

Full of longing
not for the answesr
  but meaning
not looking for knowledge
  looking for life
  for belonging

I've got questions
  and fear
about what you'll say
  if I ask
  if I answer

I've got questions
but will I ask?
Who will answer?
