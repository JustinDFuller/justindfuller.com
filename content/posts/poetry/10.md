```
The curse of the prince
is to see the treasure in his hands
as nothing more,
than the commonest trash

As he crawls through the mud
he imagines himself
the heir to the throne
resplindent in majesty,
he awaits his bride

And 'lo, as she rides 
down from her castle
high on the hill,
she takes great pity
on his plight

From her white mare,
she extends a hand,
feeds him and drapes him
in royal clothes

She falls deeply in love,
promising her undying 
love and devotion

How does he repay her?
With a spit in the face,
a slap, a yell

He curses and bemoans her
as worthless

Because the curse of the fool,
is to think he's a prince,
who sees the treasure in his hands,
as nothing more
than the commonest trash
