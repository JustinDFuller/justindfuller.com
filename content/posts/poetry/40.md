```
The carpenter sits
at a workbench
before 
  hammer
  chisel
  and plank

Slowly,
deliberately,
carefully carves,
skillfully shapes

Each line,
grotesque knot,
of original form

The artist
a splotch of moss
hues of gray
the delicate green
of each leaf

The gardener
plants the lie
among the truth

The philosopher
beholds,
declares:
  before me stands a tree
  the truth is real
  undeniable
  simply open your eyes
  and you will not be
  deceived
