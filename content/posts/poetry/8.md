What is wisdom?

If someone has knowledge
of the future,
they are a seer
or prophet

If someone has knowledge
of the past,
they are a historian,
or have memories

If one has knowledge
of that which
is not perceptible,
they are a clairvoyant

If instead they have knowledge
of reality,
they may be a scientist,
or said to be informed

But what is left for wisdom?

One with self-knowledge is enlightened,
of the present is aware,
of others-empathetic

What if wisdom
is nothing at all,
but all of the above?

When knowledge holds true — wise
When fails — foolish
