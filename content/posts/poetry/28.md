```
Stop!
Don't be so quick
to throw off
that blanket of loneliness

An ant with its colony
never stops to think,
where am I headed?

But the heron,
lonely, wary, proud,
waits patiently,
stalking the shore;
no other chooses her nest,
no leader pulls her
to a lake,
pointing, to say:
there! fish!

I shudder at the thought
of being alone
I am repulsed by the thought
of being together

Snug in this blanket,
there is nothing left,
except to confront myself

I salute this coopers hawk
circling, lonely in the sky;
You heed none,
except death

In this temple
I'm left with no choice
but to consider myself
