```
Pleasure is the
highest virtue

Love is the pleasure
of another
Joy is the pleasure
of the heart
Wisdom is the pleasure
of the mind
Justice is the pleasure
of the oppressed

Worship is pleasure
for God
Kindness is pleasure
for another
Charity is pleasure
for the poor
Equality is pleasure
for all

All other virtues
lead to pleasure
