```
Why did you read my poems?
They aren't for you
This is an invasion of privacy
Do you like them?
They are about you
What do they make you feel?
They are about life
Please don't tell anyone
They are about truth
and justice and love
I hope you liked them
and told all your friends
how talented I am
They're about sadness
I'm so embarrassed
Peoms end in lovers meeting
Did you send them
to your mother?
I'm really not talented
but one day I hope to be
I listened while you
called your sister,
why didn't you tell her?
I'm thinking of writing
to a publisher
I ran out of ideas
I wrote three more today
this is the depth of my soul,
bared for you
It really is a private notebook,
you know
I press my face against the door,
you talk about the weather,
your mother
Poems end in lovers meeting
It really is private,
an invasion of privacy
