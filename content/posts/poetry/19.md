```
I set out to climb this mountain,
to venture into
the depths of the range,
breathe deeply
the cool highland air

Before I leave,
I sit on my front porch
to lace my boots;
I search for courage;
ask, is this really
what I want?

Despite my fear,
despite my reservations,
I stand, begin to walk;
my pace strong,
my steps sure;
I will reach my destination

With each step,
my heart begins to beat harder,
first in anticipation;
then, agony

With each step,
this mountain,
this object that holds all my desire,
she moves away from me

I pause,
soaking up the rejection;
but how can I be angry
at one who looms so large?

Instead, I smile,
wish it the best,
and head home
