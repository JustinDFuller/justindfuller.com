```
I have a little problem with truth;
It's just this:
I can't figure out
what it is;
So I'm starting to worry,
it doesn't exist

I know what you'll say,
truth has to exist!
These word sit before me,
we both know it's true

Of course, I must ask,
how do you know?
What do we,
if I disagree?

The answer,
obvious and simple

We'll both take a look,
investigate the claim,
if our opinions come out
the same,
we've done it,
found the truth

But what have we found?
Not an atom of truth;
an agreement of opinion,
a similarity of experience

There is nothing to put
under the microscope,
even if there was,
how would we know it's the truth?

So, that's where I'm at,
at odds with the truth
