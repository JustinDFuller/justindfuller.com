```
Do you ever think
of space,
then worry,
you'll float right out into it?

Have you ever been
on a plane,
imagined the bottom disappeared?
Then made yourself stop,
too worried you might fall through?

Did you once read an article,
about space energy,
so powerful and fast,
it would obliterate the earth
in a second
and we'd never see it coming?
But you can't think about it,
in case you make it happen?

Yeah, me neither...
