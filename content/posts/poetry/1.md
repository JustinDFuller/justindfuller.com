```
The passing traveler
caught by the glimmer
of your window

Peers inside,
for a moment blinded
caught off guard

What he beholds,
a remote wonder
stands strong and proud,
filled with persian rugs
draped with antiquity
books of magic

Unable to repress
he opens the glass

But he is swept away
by the wind of will

By the story
of heartbreak
and healing

Despite please
from his fellow travelers
he falls into
a current of life

He accepts no branch
nor rope

He eludes the shore
Electing the depths

For the traveler
has found
his destination
