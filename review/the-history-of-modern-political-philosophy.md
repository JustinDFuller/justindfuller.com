# The History of Modern Political Philosophy

The Modern era of political philosophy lasted from roughly the 17th to 20th century. The ranks of Philosophers from this time include some as early as Machiavelli (born 1469) and as late as Engels (born 1820). A wide range, for sure.

You see, it is not the colloquial Modern in Modern Political Philosophy—meaning the opposite of ancient. Instead, it is a specific period of time and cultural norms that followed the renaissance. It’s an era.

Even wider than the range of time is its range of topics. Reading the political philosophers of this age, you’ll encounter ideas ranging from the ideal way for a prince to commit atrocities to consolidate power to arguments for feminism and communism.

I invite you to join me for a brief stroll through some of the era’s biggest topics and most famous thinkers.

## State of Nature

Many of the big ideas of political philosophy are rooted in or explained by a “State of Nature” hypothesis. Our imperfect state of society naturally leads us to wonder: what came before? Was it better or worse? Importantly, could that pre-society period contain any insights we could learn from or warnings we should heed? Canonical political philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and even Marx used State of Nature hypotheses to explain and justify their ideas.

### Hobbes

Hobbes famously speculated life in a State of Nature was, “nasty, brutish, and short.” This view was possibly due to the English civil wars and the execution of King Charles I, where he glimpsed what anarchical society can devolve to. Consequently, he feared our natural state was one of constant war between every man. The State of Nature was actually a State of War. This thought led him to propose a—surprisingly liberal—system led by a dictator he calls, “the sovereign.”

Anarchy was the worst outcome for Hobbes. So, he decided it would be best to give his sovereign complete control. The people still had to agree to anoint the sovereign with power, but once this was done the sovereign retained it in perpetuity. There can be no disagreeing with his sovereign, no voting them out, and no resisting orders.

There was one and only one exception. Hobbes said you can resist if the sovereign attempts to take your life. Why? Because the sovereign’s job is to protect you. Taking your life means the sovereign is not fulfilling their end of the bargain, so you may resist.

Since Hobbes saw the State of Nature entirely as a State of War, he sought to completely avoid regressing to it. This led him to the extreme position of granting total power to his sovereign. Let’s continue to a few other modern political philosophers to see how their view of nature influenced their philosophy.

### Locke

After a long enough period for society to stabilize, came John Locke. Where Hobbes equated the State of Nature with a State of War, Locke saw two distinct states—perhaps due to the increased stability during Locke’s time. 

In Locke’s mind, the ideal periods were the State of Nature. There, humans worked well together and with nature. They cooperated and only used resources necessary for survival. They only entered the State of War when they used more than necessary or when they disagreed. Locke claimed the State of War was rare and could swiftly end by the administration of justice. After all, we have the right to defend ourselves in the States of Nature and War.

However, it is exactly the administration of justice that led Locke to believe we need a neutral authority. You see, Locke thought we are pretty terrible judges in our own disputes. While we are capable of ending the State of War, we tend to end it far too decisively. Our punishments are unnecessarily harsh. So, we need an authority over us that can help us decide these cases fairly—keeping us out of the State of War.

Over what exactly do these disputes occur? Private property, according to Locke. He believed the state’s primary mission was to maintain private property and resolve disputes. This covered the most important parts of our lives because he believed private property encompassed much of what we care about. First, our bodies are the main private property we own. However, when we use our body’s labor and mix it with something else, say, nature, then we can create more private property. For example, when we use our labor to pick an apple, we have mixed our body (which is our private property) with the apple, transforming the apple into our property too.

Since private property encompasses both our body and the things we own, Locke believed the government should focus on maintaining our individual private property rights. This government did not enjoy the unlimited power of Hobbes’ sovereign—even though both must be created by the will of the people. Instead, this government enjoys only the right of (and only so long as it continues) protecting private property.

While Hobbes saw the State of Nature as a horrible place, Locke saw it as both good and bad. So, instead of giving up total power to avoid ever reentering a nature-like position, he gives up only what is necessary to avoid the difficult parts of the State of Nature—disputes over private property.

As you can see, we progressed from negative to neutral views about the State of Nature. Now, what if a philosopher saw it positively?

### Rousseau

Hobbes and Locke wanted to improve on the State of Nature by refactoring society based on Nature’s faults. Now, along comes Rousseau who seeks the opposite: to improve the State of Society based on the State of Nature’s virtues. While the other philosophers saw the State of Nature as problematic, Rousseau saw it as ideal. 

In Rousseau’s conception of nature, humans have pity for each other. This pity leads them to follow the axiom of nature, which instructs each person to do what is best for themselves while doing as little harm as possible to others. The pity—or compassion—they felt for each other created peace.

Then he takes it further: the humans in Rousseau’s nature are simple. They are not specialized in any particular field and instead know only what (and everything that) is necessary for survival. This means they do not depend on each other. Since his humans only depend on nature and themselves, the only possible inequality is natural—the inequality of nature and chance. It is only when we enter a State of Society that we create a new, social inequality. Social inequality only occurs between humans in society and is made of social status, reputation, and other unnatural notions. This social inequality was far worse to Rousseau.

How can we fix social inequality? By reacquiring our pity. He believed it is not our rationality that saves us (on the contrary, it is what hurts us by stamping out our pity) but our passions, our compassion. This leads him to propose a society where the people think of the group instead of themselves. Its government is run by the people. Instead of making laws to fix their problems, they search for the general will—that which is good for the group, even if not for the individual. The general will is then translated and enforced by an impartial government who seeks to apply the general will to individual cases.

Hobbes and Locke believed the State of Nature was problematic, so we needed a society that could protect us from its problems. But, as you can see, Rousseau believed the State of Nature was better, so we need to change society to reacquire the parts we lost while leaving nature. He believed we need to reacquire our compassion. 

Next we’ll talk about another Philosopher who thought the State of Nature was better than the State of Society. Except, while Rousseau thought society could never be as good as nature, this philosopher thought society could become a better form of what naturally occurs.

### Marx

Karl Marx had mixed feelings about a State of Nature hypothesis. At one time, he poked fun at them, saying they were merely made-up ideas that never happened. Later—perhaps when he felt it better suited his needs—he made the claim that the State of Nature was a period of basic communism.

As surprising as that may sound, it does make sense. But to understand why, we need to understand what communism is. The basic idea of communism is the end of private property. Particularly, it is about the end of the private ownership of the means of production. The means of production are that which produces the things we need to survive: farms, factories, machinery, transportation, and the like. Instead of private ownership, he believed these critical systems should belong equally to everyone. No longer would they be used to enslave us (according to Marx) but to sustain us.

Now, what is the means of production in the State of Nature? If you assume the State of Nature is humans living off nature, then the means of production is merely the human body, perhaps a few basic tools, and nature. Of course, our bodies are privately owned. Perhaps small tools were private or shared with the group. But the big one: nature, was shared equally by everyone. This created a society (or lack thereof) where every human had equal right to the resources necessary to survive. There was no arbitrary scarcity—although there was of course real scarcity if nature did not provide.

Unlike Rousseau, who saw nature as the ideal, Marx believed this basic communism could improve. Our industry has reduced the likelihood of natural scarcity only to replace it with artificial. He believed that by sharing the means of production (nature and all of the industry we’ve created to harness it) we could nearly eliminate both natural and artificial scarcity.

### Purposes

The State of Nature hypothesis serves as a problem statement for each philosopher. What problem is their system solving? 

For Hobbes, it’s solving for the anarchy that ensues when a government loses control. For Locke, the disputes over ownership that naturally occur between people. Then it swaps for Rousseau, who begins solving not for a problem in the state of nature but in society: the lack of pity and related inequality. Finally, Marx solves for problems in both the States of Nature and Society by combining the best of both—eliminating the natural scarcity of nature and the artificial scarcity of society.

Each philosopher solves a problem in either the state of nature or the state of society by looking to the other for inspiration; either for what to strive toward or what to avoid.
