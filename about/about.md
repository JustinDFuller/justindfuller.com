## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Justin Fuller

I'm a Staff Software Engineer at [The New York Times](https://open.nytimes.com).

### At The Times

I am the tech lead for a group of teams called Access and Messaging Systems. This comprises the teams Onsite Messaging, Offers, Access, and Auth.

Most recently, I architected, built, shipped, and led a successful migration to the next generation of systems that decide which messages we show on our paywall and other spaces across web and mobile.

Before that, I architected and led multiple teams to build features like [Subscriber Gift Articles](https://open.nytimes.com/a-new-way-to-share-new-york-times-stories-3e66e8d7e620?source=collection_home---4------8-----------------------).

And many of our Gift Subscription features.

### My Projects

In my free time, I build projects that make my life better.

#### Purchase Plan

I built [purchaseplan.io](https://www.purchaseplan.io) to plan my purchases.

#### Really Simple Notes

I built [reallysimplenotes.com](https://www.reallysimplenotes.com) to help me focus on the content, rather than style, of my notes.

#### Better Interviews

And I'm building [betterinterview.club](https://www.betterinterview.club) to reduce bias in interviews.
