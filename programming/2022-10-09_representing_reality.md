You and I do not live in reality. We do not experience reality. Our senses perceive reality, the physical reality of the world, and represent it to us in a form we can experience. These are the forms of color, touch, taste, smell. There is no physical reality of any of these. These are interpretations—made by our senses—of the physical reality. They attempt to represent what our physical body experiences, but they are not themselves what our physical body experiences.

This means that we don't directly experience reality. We experience it through a filter. Worse, those filters are imperfect. For example, our eyes cannot interpret and represent the entire color spectrum for us. Likewise, our ears cannot interpret and represent the entire sound frequency spectrum.

So, not only do we experience a filtered reality. We experience only a fraction of reality.

Still, it gets even worse. We do not—and here, when I say we, I mean our minds, our thoughts—interact with these physical representations. We think of them only through abstractions, concepts, ideas. We do not live in the physical world. We live in the world of ideas.

When you look at me, you do not see the physical parts that make me. You do not see the atoms that make my skin, hair, eyes, and clothes. You do not even see the combined form that those atoms create. You experience only the light that bounces between these forms. But you do not perceive that light. You perceive color and shape. This is the interpretation your body assigned to the light waves. Further stil, you do not think of these interpretations directly. You use ideas and classifications such as light. You abstract them further into specific colors and shapes. You continue to abstract, even higher, to beings, specie, and animal.

I do this too. I've done it in every word you just experienced. Not one word was anything but an abstraction or idea. We cannot even talk about the physical reality because our words are abstract.

To put it plainly: we are doomed to live forever in the world of ideas.

Now, all hope need not be lost. There is no reason to think any of this bad, unnatural or even problematic. In fact, you could even see it as a positive.

Take an extreme example. What if we had to interact individually with each atom without the aid of sensual representation or idea logical, abstract groupings? I cannot even fathom how we would do such a thing.

So, living in the world of ideas is helpful. But, not always.

Sometimes we venture too far into the world of ideas. We go so far that we become detached from the reality that we sought to represent.

We do this when we build up a picture of someone in our mind that represents a totally different person than reality.

We do this when we create a picture of ourselves that does not reflect reality.

We all do this, to a greater or lesser extent.

A prime example of this is how we play out imaginary conversations or scenarios in our head. The people in our imagination act and feel totally different than their real counterpart. In our imagination they love us back, they are mean, they are present; they are anything except the real person.

When someone lives in a world of ideas, and to be clear, we all live in a different world of ideas, that is divorced from reality, we call that person delusional.

But we are all at least a little deluded. We are always living in a world that is at least slightly divorced from reality.

Sometimes, we become so separated from reality that we can no longer reliably interact with it.

But many of us seek to grow closer to reality.

The goal of philosophy is to find strategies to help us accurately represent reality. The goal of science is to _use_ one of those strategies to understand reality. The goal of engineering is to manipulate reality. The goal of art is to transmit our world of ideas into the world of reality.

In our relationships, we seek to alter and understand each other's reality.

What should our goal be then? To move our world of ideas toward reality? To move reality toward our world of ideas? Or to escape the world of reality into a world of ideas that's completely free?
