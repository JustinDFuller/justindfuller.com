## The Main Function

Now there is both a channel writer and a channel reader. Let's see how to put it all together in the `main` function.

```go
func main() {
    channel := make(chan string)
    for _, url := range urls {
        go fetch(url, channel)
    }

    results := stringSliceFromChannel(len(urls), channel)

    fmt.Printf("Results: %v\n", results)
}
```

First, a channel is created to collect the fetch results, `channel := make(chan string)`.

Next, the `urls` are looped over, creating a goroutine to fetch each url. 

```go
for _, url := range urls {
    go fetch(url, channel)
}
```

This allows the fetching to happen concurrently.

After the fetches have been kicked off, `stringSliceFromChannel` will block until either the results are in or the timeout occurs.

```go
results := stringSliceFromChannel(len(urls), channel)
```

Finally, we can print the results to see which URLs are returned. If you run this code in the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/g3RnP9A26v5), remember to change the timeout number since the random number generator will always return the same results.

## Caveats

It could seem like I'm suggesting that you should always use channels instead of waitgroups or mutexes. I'm not. Each tool is designed for a specific use case, [and each has a tradeoff](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/MutexOrChannel). Instead of walking away from this post thinking, "I should always use channels, they're so much better than anything else." I hope you will simply consider if you can improve the clarity of your program with a channel, rather than sharing memory. If not, don't use them.

## Final Thoughts

Here's the cool thing. We started out talking about how Go has first-class concurrency support with goroutines and channels. Then we saw how easy it is to implement a complex concurrent pattern, a timeout, with a single channel and a few goroutines. Over my next few posts, I hope to show that this was only scratching the surface of what one can do with concurrency in Go. I hope you'll check back in. (Better yet, [subscribe to my newsletter](https://justindfuller.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=d48d0debd8d0bce3b77572097&id=0c1e610cac) to be updated each month about my new posts)

Finally, even though this is a neat concurrency pattern, it's unrealistic. As an exercise you could open the [Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/g3RnP9A26v5) to see if you can implement these scenarios:

* The results should be returned as a JSON object. Maybe we could use a struct instead of an array of URLs?
* A blank page is useless, the code should at least wait until there is one result to display.
* The [context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/) type is often used with http handlers. Can you replace the `time.After` with an expiring context?
