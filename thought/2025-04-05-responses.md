Not all responses to an idea, suggestion, thought are created equal. Here is a brief ranking of the types of responses.

1. Unnoticed misunderstanding.
2. Correct, neutral regurgitation.
3. Acknowledge lack of comprehension.
4. Creating a competing but equal alternative.
5. Creating a superior alternative.
6. Creating a new paradigm that obviates the need for the disputed point.
