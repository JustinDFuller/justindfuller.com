            <p class="featured-post-excerpt">My question is, if we as a community figured out — twenty years ago — that we should stop rewriting programs, why is it still commonly done today?</p>

            <p class="featured-post-excerpt">The story I have to tell you today is not the story I wished to tell. In fact, I am loath to repeat much of it. I pray antiquity and modernity alike judge me not as an author, nor even as editor, but as a trembling witness. Reluctant to confess what he has seen, yet compelled by his conscience to reveal the devilry that took place at the autumn equinox on the outskirts of a great Carolina wilderness.</p>

            <p class="featured-post-excerpt">This notes app is a little different than some you might have used before. First, you may notice there are no styling options. That's because styling tends to get in the way. You won't find bold, italics, or any other styles. This helps you focus on what matters: writing notes.</p>
