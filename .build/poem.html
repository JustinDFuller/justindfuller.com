The carpenter sits
at a workbench
before 
  hammer
  chisel
  and plank

Slowly,
deliberately,
carefully carves,
skillfully shapes

Each line,
grotesque knot,
of original form

The artist
a splotch of moss
hues of gray
the delicate green
of each leaf

The gardener
plants the lie
among the truth

The philosopher
beholds,
declares:
  before me stands a tree
  the truth is real
  undeniable
  simply open your eyes
  and you will not be
  deceived

It can happen
on the quietest street
or the busiest avenue;
in the smallest house
or the greatest mansion

I found it
sitting on the floor
building trains
with my son

In the living room
singing and dancing
to Hamilton
with my daughter

Huddled over the crib
whispering my baby to sleep

I found it
in Hyde park
on an unusually sunny day
just you and I
when we were young

It's there
with my doodle's head
resting on my feet
as I work

It's everywhere
in everything
at every moment

I just have to remember
to look

I'm not looking
for love like wine
drunk, fun, out of control

I have love like water
cool, clear, refreshing

Love like the rapids
is exhilerating
and exhausting
I'm here
for the smooth,
steady ride
on the current

We'll hold hands
never growing tired
watching the birds
fly over our heads

I used to think
as we float down the river
we'd get bored,
drift apart
that the current 
would weaken and slow

How wrong I was
How glad I am

Do you ever think
of space,
then worry,
you'll float right out into it?

Have you ever been
on a plane,
imagined the bottom disappeared?
Then made yourself stop,
too worried you might fall through?

Did you once read an article,
about space energy,
so powerful and fast,
it would obliterate the earth
in a second
and we'd never see it coming?
But you can't think about it,
in case you make it happen?

Yeah, me neither...

I used to be
so scared of death;
Used to be,
I couldn't talk,
couldn't think
about it

My body felt so close,
like it was ready
to slip away
at any moment;
every little twinge
and I thought
  "This is it"

At least,
until you came along;
grabbed me by the shoulders,
stared me square in the eyes

I am going to die.
So are you.
So is everyone you love.

Eventually,
everything you've ever known,
ever touched,
will turn to dust;
not even a memory

You can't fight it
You can't change it

You can only pretend
and deny it
    ignore it

Or, accept it,
embrace it,
make the most of it

I have so many questions
  is it my super power
  or curse?

I have so many questions
  no answers

Always questions,
  never when it matters

Plenty of questions,
  nothing interesting to say

Full of questions
  looking for the laughter
  maybe some joy, too

Full of longing
not for the answers
  but meaning
not looking for knowledge
  looking for life
  for belonging

I've got questions
  and fear
about what you'll say
  if I ask
  if I answer

I've got questions
but will I ask?
Who will answer?

We're talking,
but through a brick wall;
I hear your words,
sure,
and you hear mine,
but not my heart,
not my soul

I want you to hear it,
I really do;
I let out
the faintest whisper,
but no more

Let's take out
our hammers,
smash holes
in this wall

Let me pour you a glass
of my desire;
an unfiltered cup
of my adoration;
I have so much
to share

My hammer is ready;
I'll hire a wrecking crew,
will you?

But I won't,
because you'll reject me
and I'll be left
without even the whisper
that I hear now

          </p>

To abandon expectation
is to be rid
of disappointment;
All who let the shroud of desire
fall to their feet,
will notice also
discontentment,
lying dormant on the floor,
a lathargic hound,
his bite a distant memory;
but now,
which dogmatic montra
to take up its place?
That stoic aversion
of all that does not align
with nature?
But which nature to align to?
How about,
an epicurean pursuit
of pleasure?
But which can one taste
while shunning
the tantalizing eye of desire?
Perhaps only the silence
of that final dream
will bring the reprieve
we seek;
Shall we sit and wait
or usher it forward?
Better yet,
can we accept,
take up the path fortune designed?
Can we simply enjoy the hike; 
divets, thorns, and all?
Without searching for
that mystic trail
that does not exist

        <div style="text-align: center;">
          <p style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
            
We are so far
from even the smallest
grain of knowledge;
we have not yet tasted
the sweet nectar
of truth;
yet we walk around
like proud roosters
ready to attack
anything that approaches
the coop we built
for ourselves;
we've confused the reflection
in the puddle at our feet,
for the stars in the sky

I stand on the precipice of insanity,
curiously peering over,
wondering at the feeling
of that detached air
caressing my face,
whispering in my ear;
at the attempt to lean further, 
the hands holding me
grasp my attention,
I will not dive,
not to those unseen depths,
I will not climb,
not to those blasphemous heights;
oh how I long to swim,
no, fear to drown, in those
other-wordly waters,
oh how they draw me in;
I will snap every connection
in my brain like a glowstick,
and walk in a light
none other can ever see,
I will float among the stars
of a galaxy that belongs
only to me;
I look up at the mountain
of delusion, scream
for her avalanche
to wipe me away, no,
to wipe away my chains,
to set me free;
my wrists strain 
against their chains,
no, your hands, even as
my feet leave the ground;
I will live in psychotic freedom,
bathe in deranged waters,
sup on the imaginary;
if only I can escape,
if only I can break,
the grip of reality

I've seen true beauty;
it was made,
of the most dazzling blues,
that even on a sunny day,
made the sky, look gray;
the richest browns,
so pure and fine,
that even the most
gorgeous chocolate,
grows mold in my eyes;
and the brightest white,
I cannot describe,
that to everything else,
now, I am blind

I think
we should cut
God some slack;
he went, and had,
a billion children;
I'm going crazy,
with just three

Stop!
Don't be so quick
to throw off
that blanket of loneliness

An ant with its colony
never stops to think,
where am I headed?

But the heron,
lonely, wary, proud,
waits patiently,
stalking the shore;
no other chooses her nest,
no leader pulls her
to a lake,
pointing, to say:
there! fish!

I shudder at the thought
of being alone
I am repulsed by the thought
of being together

Snug in this blanket,
there is nothing left,
except to confront myself

I salute this coopers hawk
circling, lonely in the sky;
You heed none,
except death

In this temple
I'm left with no choice
but to consider myself

Does a mountain
feel its grandeur?
Does a lake 
know its depth?

The dead don't attend
our memorials
don't heed
our admiration

Tomorrow will never come
Next time will not exist

So, let us 
love and cherish 
each other

While we have 
the chance

Who am I?
I don't want to know

Even in front 
of the mirror,
I close my eyes;
Even in the quiet
room of my thoughts,
I hum a tune

A little of you,
a little gentler,
a little less brave

Am I the sun?
Rising in the hopeful east,
Setting in the lonely west

A little of you,
a little more open,
a little less righteous

Am I who I want to be?
And how would I know?

Even if you tell me,
I'll cover my ears

A little of you,
a little more collected,
a little more skeptical

Am I the moon?
Reflecting you,
No life of my own

Who am I?
I want you to know

Why did you read my poems?
They aren't for you
This is an invasion of privacy
Do you like them?
They are about you
What do they make you feel?
They are about life
Please don't tell anyone
They are about truth
and justice and love
I hope you liked them
and told all your friends
how talented I am
They're about sadness
I'm so embarrassed
Peoms end in lovers meeting
Did you send them
to your mother?
I'm really not talented
but one day I hope to be
I listened while you
called your sister,
why didn't you tell her?
I'm thinking of writing
to a publisher
I ran out of ideas
I wrote three more today
this is the depth of my soul,
bared for you
It really is a private notebook,
you know
I press my face against the door,
you talk about the weather,
your mother
Poems end in lovers meeting
It really is private,
an invasion of privacy

Oh truth! Oh truth!
You have to be real;
If there's no truth,
how can I know,
right from wrong?
If this pen is in my hand?
Without truth,
what can I know?

My sweet child,
my innocent child,
what is this truth you seek?
Can you point to it?
Can you sense it?

Don't be obtuse,
I can't point to the truth
but that doesn't make it
any less true
that this pen is in my hand,
this blanket is grey

And which part 
of the pen,
which strands of fabric,
hold that truth?

You infernal skeptic!
You dense man,
it just means
we both see it,
we both feel it,
over and over

It's just a word
that describes
the reliability
of experience

The foolish boy,
what did he expect?
He asked for patience,
I gave him
three energetic kids;
He asked for wisdom,
I gave him questions to answer;
He asked for courage,
I gave him difficult times

Did he expect
a bolt of courage
from above?
Wisdom slipped
into his mind
as he sleeps?

No, I designed him
with these muscles
from the start

All that's left
is to exercise them;
Shall I lift the weights for him?

What's next, will he sneeze
and pray for someone
to wipe his nose?

My three little critters
rise before the dawn,
Daddy, will you play with me?
They cry and tug my arm

Eyes open to open eyes,
will pit against will;
One to stay asleep,
the other, to start the day

I stumble to the bathroom,
my three little ducks
all in a row;
Wash my face, brush teeth,
change without privacy

At the stairs, Daddy up!
Do the silly run?
Hey, what about me?
Up and down again

Will you eat a banana? No
Cereal? No. Bagel? No.
Then what do you want?
Can I have a banana?

Two coffees, four baristas,
one dog ready to go out,
one spilled milk,
one childish squabble;
Stop to take my zolies

Trash to go out,
dishes in the sink,
did everyone eat?
Is everyone dressed?
The dog wants pets,
Daddy ew! We need a diaper.

My three little lovelies,
ready for the day

I have a little problem with truth;
It's just this:
I can't figure out
what it is;
So I'm starting to worry,
it doesn't exist

I know what you'll say,
truth has to exist!
These words sit before me,
we both know it's true

Of course, I must ask,
how do you know?
What do we,
if I disagree?

The answer,
obvious and simple

We'll both take a look,
investigate the claim,
if our opinions come out
the same,
we've done it,
found the truth

But what have we found?
Not an atom of truth;
an agreement of opinion,
a similarity of experience

There is nothing to put
under the microscope,
even if there was,
how would we know it's the truth?

So, that's where I'm at,
at odds with the truth

I set out to climb this mountain,
to venture into
the depths of the range,
breathe deeply
the cool highland air

Before I leave,
I sit on my front porch
to lace my boots;
I search for courage;
ask, is this really
what I want?

Despite my fear,
despite my reservations,
I stand, begin to walk;
my pace strong,
my steps sure;
I will reach my destination

With each step,
my heart begins to beat harder,
first in anticipation;
then, agony

With each step,
this mountain,
this object that holds all my desire,
she moves away from me

I pause,
soaking up the rejection;
but how can I be angry
at one who looms so large?

Instead, this other me,
this man I may never know,
he smiles,
wishes it the best,
and heads home

Uneven love,
is there any other kind?

What's worse,
to hand your heart over,
or hold another's 
in your hands?

To watch them 
treat it carelessly,
or agonize over
every misstep,
lest you break it?

And why would we agree,
to such an arrangement,
but that we have
no other choice

For uneven love,
itself uneven;
one day
you hand your heart over,
the next, I, mine

Over and over,
children in a game;
shattering,
mending,
carefully and carelessly,
until we are
no more

I asked God
the meaning of life,
but it turns out,
I disagree

He claimed it to be
all about Him
and his majesty

If I'm being
perfectly honest
that seems
kind-of selfish
and perhaps
a bit pompous

So I set out
to ask that question
to everyone I meet

What I heard,
  family
  friendship
  love
  success
  power
  sadness
  death
made no sense
until I realized,
life has only the meaning
that we give it

Remember me,
when I die;
don't bury me
in a tomb
of wood, or stone,
but of history

To be hated
by my neighbor
is to be a nuisance,
but by his kin,
infamy

To be loved
by my son
is a bond,
but by his son,
legacy

Not my body
will preserve,
but this ink;
It's not me
they'll remember,
but these words

Immortality,
out of reach,
even with my name
on every tongue;
my memory,
in every heart,
for all of time

Me?  I'll be,
a million, trillion particles,
afloat in the universe

I sit on the sidewalk
as you pass me by;
hold out my hat,
shake it a little;
  spare any praise,
  praise for the insecure?

From the corner of your eye,
you size me up,
judge if I'm worthy

As you walk away,
I rise to my feet
  begin to dance
  begin to sing
Anything you might
want to hear

Still, you walk faster
  begin to beg
  begin to scream
Just a bit of praise
for the insecure

You turn around
you face me down
  begin to laugh
  begin to jeer

The whole street joins in
  I back down
  turn away
  run and hide

Well, anyway,
that's why I didn't share
my idea

I love a good heresy,
as much as the next guy

Don't think that thought!
  I think I  will

Don't ask that question!
  Don't mind if I do

What's got you so scared,
scared to be wrong?
Try it sometime,
it's actually quite fun

In fact, I'm doing it now
being wrong,
wrong in nine different ways

The only problem,
you see,
is that I don't know how,
don't know where,
where I'm wrong

For that I visit
the church of heresy,
kneel at the altar
of curiosity

There I meet God,
which one?
You might know.

To find out
you'll need a little
heresy

What is justice
but the good
of the weaker?

Can you imagine
a king crying for justice?

Can you imagine
a ruler complaining of oppression?

Only the powerless
can beg for justice
Only the powerful
can give it

But if the powerless
can sway a ruler
are they powerless?

If the oppressed
can move their king
are they oppressed?

Justice comes
from the powerful
when they think
of the weak

Injustice,
when they think
of themselves

Pleasure is the
highest virtue

Joy is the pleasure
of the heart
Wisdom is the pleasure
of the mind
Love is the pleasure
of another
Justice is the pleasure
of the oppressed

Worship is pleasure
for God
Kindness is pleasure
for another
Charity is pleasure
for the poor
Equality is pleasure
for all

All other virtues
lead to pleasure

The crescendo, 
cacophony,
a boorish wave
strikes my drums

The hammer
smites my nerves,
sensation places his shackles
around my wrists,
declares himself my master

Let him have it, I say,
that destitute shell;
for after a tierce,
I am away

Journeying inward
devoid of perception,
Philo grasps my trembling hand,
leading me to
the court of Justicia,
the hall of Sophia

I study under their gaze,
this inpenetrable fortress,
this fraudulent solitude

The curse of the prince
is to see the treasure in his hands
as nothing more,
than the commonest trash

As he crawls through the mud
he imagines himself
the heir to the throne
resplindent in majesty,
he awaits his bride

And lo, as she rides 
down from her castle
high on the hill,
she takes great pity
on his plight

From her white mare,
she extends a hand,
feeds him and drapes him
in royal clothes

She falls deeply in love,
promising her undying devotion

How does he repay her?
With a spit in the face,
a slap, a yell

He curses and bemoans her
as worthless

Because the curse of the fool,
is to think he's a prince,
who sees the treasure in his hands,
as nothing more
than the commonest trash

  As the default configuration
  is less than desirable,
  you should immediately consider
  the following tweaks

  First, you should note
  the sensors are linked
  directly to the controls.
  This is suboptimal because
  any input can cause 
  an unwanted behavior

  You should reroute the sensors
  through the central processor,
  allowing it to determine
  what is to be done
  with each sensation

  However, one may find 
  the velocity of sensation
  to quickly overwhelm the processor.
  This brings about the next change,
  that most input is to be ignored.

  Now you must manually 
  assent to, deny, or withold 
  judgement on each input

  But what should you assent to?
  Only that which is aligned with nature.
  Which is a made up concept 
  that means:

That which you think right.

What is wisdom?

If someone has knowledge
of the future,
they are a seer
or prophet

If someone has knowledge
of the past,
they are a historian,
or have memories

If one has knowledge
of that which
is not perceptible,
they are a clairvoyant

If instead they have knowledge
of reality,
they may be a scientist,
or said to be informed

But what is left for wisdom?

One with self-knowledge is enlightened,
of the present is aware,
of others-empathetic

What if wisdom
is nothing at all,
but all of the above?

When knowledge holds true — wise
When fails — foolish

What is this feeling
down in my chest?

I'm being gripped
squeezed, twisted

If this is supposed
to be a good life,
how can anyone survive
a bad life?

If this is a rich life
how empty is a poor life?

Why can't I laugh
Why can't I cry
Why does it all feel so empty

Why is it
that the things I know most intimately
are the things
I can explain least clearly?

I think this thought,
but what is it?

I push my feelings away,
but where do they go?

I hold fast
to these concepts
until I try
to touch them

Only then
do I discover
the mirage

What if we're connected
to the ones we love the most
by an invisible cord
that extends from host to host?

The sensations of connection
produced directly
from this bond

Think about it

New love is hot
because the link
is newly smelted
and has not yet cooled

But as it has not set
it may easily split

Old love is steady
because the link has hardened

But when left unchecked
it becomes inflexible

Then, it may get in the way
and must be painfully removed

This link is why it hurt
when we were far apart

But once the link expanded
the pain did fade away

To keep its health
I prescribe a regimine
of heating
   cooling
   hammering
   twisting

As long as it's attached

I built this house
one brick at a time

A wall here
some stairs there
  a castle
  a cathederal
  a den
  a home

I laid these bricks
year after year

Til it was done
and I, safe inside

Alas, I forgot to add
a door

you and I
in the dark
unable to see

We feel nothing
yet from time to time

  Here it is!

My hands may be empty
but at least I know
nothing is there

The passing traveler
caught by the glimmer
of your window

Peers inside,
for a moment blinded
caught off guard

What he beholds,
a remote wonder
stands strong and proud,
filled with persian rugs,
draped with antiquity,
books of magic

Unable to repress
he opens the glass

But he is swept away
by the wind of will

By the story
of heartbreak
and healing

Despite pleas
from his fellow travelers
he dives into
a current of life

He accepts no branch
nor rope

He eludes the shore
electing the depths

For the traveler
has found
his destination
