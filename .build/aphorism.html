            Man is semi-rational at best. Capable of perceiving rationality but incapable of fully realizing it.

            There is no such thing as a "natural right". Rights must be claimed and fought for from those with power.

            It is wrong to approach philosophy in search of perfect truth. It is wrong to discount a philosophical argument for being imperfect. The value of philosophy may sometimes be to generate more ideas.

          <p>
            Truth can only be subjective and never objective. We cannot experience or interpret anything except as a subject observing and object.

            There may be a single physical reality (or maybe not) but there is no reason to think a particular human can perfectly understand and interpret that reality.

          <p>
            Truth is only an agreement.

            Even when we don't understand something, everything continues to make sense, because we are uncomfortable with not knowing.

            Humans are fundamentally uncomfortable with the role of randomness in our lives.

            Adopt concerns as your own, don't dismiss them, but overcome them together.

            Get stuck. Make it not make sense. Empty your cup. That's when true understanding begins.

            Be brave enough to ask questions. Be secure enough to show uncertainty.

            Who would win in a battle of wisdom? Proverb or curiosity?

            Ideas are infinite, the trick is not coming up with one, but picking one.

            Dogma serves itself, but curiosity serves the truth.
