The Carolina Anole is one among over four hundred and fifty species of the genus Anolis. It is a member of the family Dactyloidae, Suborder Iguania, Class Reptilia. It primarily resides in the southeastern United States.

It is most notable for its ability to change several shades from brown to green; for its adhesive-covered toe pads that faciliate climbing; and for their bright pink dewlaps, which are primarily (but not exclusively) present in males.

A dewlap is a hanging flap of skin present in many vertebrates. The word's origin points back to the fourteenth century *dewelappe*, meaning "fold of skin that hangs from the throat." This, in turn, comes from *lappe*, meaning "loose piece." However, it is unclear where the first element, *"dew"* originated. Other creatures with notable dewlaps are the Turkey and older humans.

The dewlap does not look the same to humans and anoles. Since anoles can see a wider range of the UV spectrum, scientists speculate the dewlap reflects ultraviolet light to help attract mates.
