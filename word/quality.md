# Quality

Let's begin our discussion of Quality with Super Mario. I assert this is a movie of highest Quality.

Does it matter if: Chris Pratt doesn't know how to do an itialian accent? Half the scenes are in slow-motion? It's clearly trying to jumpstart a cinematic universe? They never really bother to explain *why* the mario bros are sucked into another universe? No!

Why not? Because of this guy:

![Kit + Mario](/image/kit_mario.jpg)

My son Kit *loves* Mario. Mario Kart is his favorite game. Catch him in his Super Mario shirt, his Mario Kart shirt, or (in cold weather) his Super Mario sweater. Did I mention he asked for (and got) a Mario themed birthday this year? So, when I went to see the Super Mario Bros movie, I didn't care about: the animation style, the soundtrack, or the story. Although, to be honest, I liked all of them. I just cared that I could enjoy seeing some Super Mario action on the big screen with my little guy. 

We laughed, we cried, we cheered, and we got excited when our favorite characters showed up on the screen (Donkey Kong for me, Peach for my daughter Max, and of course, Mario for Kit). But—surprisingly—my evaluation of Super Mario's Quality didn't quite line up with the reviews I saw.

Witless and pandering? How could we end up at such a diffent evaluation of Quality? This is (of course) an absurd question. I might as well ask, "How can people have different opinions?" But I do believe it's a useful question to ask, even if it's absurd. Indeed, you might say this question is part of entire Philsophy field: esthetics. Esthetics (or aesthetics) is focused on the idea of value judgement. Here, my esthetic question is: where does Quality exist, in the observer or the observed?

Why is this a fundamental esthetic question? Because if you place Quality in the observer, then Quality is merely opinion. However, I can't place Quality in the object alone because there are clearly different beliefs about what Quality is. Perhaps more importantly, I can't place Quality solely in the observed because I can't physically find and study Quality.

When discussing the Quality of Super Mario, I might attempt a rational analysis of the film. Did the story have plot holes? Was the lore consistent with canon? Were the characters true to their game counterparts? These "objective" or *a priori* methods of analysis might yield answers but they cannot reveal Quality because I still don't know where Quality exists. I don't know if I'm asking the right questions to reveal Quality.

I'm hardly the first person to think objective assessments of quality are problematic. Take a look at this quote from the philosopher Kant, from all the way back in the year 1790.

> If someone takes me to ~~a play~~ **the Super Mario movie** and it pleases my taste, then he can adduce all the rules established as proofs that the ~~play~~ **movie** lacks ~~beauty~~ **Quality**. I will stop my ears, listen to no reasons and arguments, and would rather believe that those rules of the critics are false than allow that my judgment should be determined by means of *a priori* grounds of proof, since it is supposed to be a judgment of taste and not of the understanding of reason.
> 
> Immanuel Kant
> *Critique of the Power of Judgment* (paraphrase)

If I like something and judge it to be Quality, can The New York Times' movie critic claim I am wrong? They may attempt to use objective reasoning, but that reasoning is based on the faulty assumption that they know which traits are important.

Now, this is a total bummber. Not for the subjecivist, content to lean against the fence to watch Quality graze, but absolutely for the person who desires to grab Quality by the horns and ride it into town. This is not to say that ones opinion is *merely* an opinion, without worth or weight of its own. It's simply to say that it's not *useful* for anyone who wants to consistently replicate Quality.

So, we must continue if we are to find anything useful. But continue where? For now, my only idea is to investigate the word *quality*: what does it mean? where does it come from?

First, the easy part. What does it mean? For this, I'll consult Webster's 1913 dictionary; the last edition written and edited by lexicographer Noah Webster.

> **Quality**
> Noun
> 1. That which makes, or helps to make, anything such as it is; anything belonging to a subject, or predicable of it; distinguishing property, characteristic, or attribute.
> <br />
> 2. The condition of being of such a sort as distinguished from others; nature or character relatively considered, as of goods; character; rank.

We seem to have two types of Quality. The first is that which makes something what it is, its attributes (little-q "quality"). The second is that which distinguishes something from others, its rank (big Q "Quality").

These are the definitions of quality. However, the dictionary includes another tidbit right at the top: *L. qualitas*. Indicating the etymology of this word; it comes from the Latin *qualitas*. The term was coined by Cicero; unsurprisingly, as he wrote three quarters of extant Latin writing. Qualitas, in turn, is a calque of the ancient Greek "ποιότης" (poiótēs), literally: "the state of being (-της) a certain nature (ποιός)".

![Little-q quality](/image/little_q_quality.png)

Little-q quality (ποιότης) appears in ancient Greek philosophy. Like in Plato's dialogue, Theaetetus, where he investigates the nature of knowledge.

> **Socrates:**
> Now perhaps quality *(ποιότης)* seems an extraordinary word, and you do not understand it when used with general application, so let me give particular examples. For the active element becomes neither heat nor whiteness, but hot or white, and other things in the same way.

Here, quality is "hot" and "white"; quality is attributes.
