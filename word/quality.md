# Quality

Let's begin our discussion of Quality here: with Super Mario.

I assert that this is a movie of highest Quality.

Does it matter that:

* Chris Pratt doesn't know how to do an itialian accent?
* Half the scenes are in slow-motion?
* It's clearly trying to jumpstart a cinematic universe?
* They never really bother to explain *why* the mario bros are sucked into another universe?

No!

Why not? Because of this guy:

My son Kit *loves* Mario. Mario Kart is his favorite game.
Catch him in his Super Mario shirt, his Mario Kart shirt, or (in cold weather) his Super Mario sweater.
Did I mention that he asked for (and got) a Mario themed birthday this year?

So, when I went to see the Super Mario Bros movie, I didn't care about:

* The animation quality
* The soundtrack
* The story

(Although to be honest I liked all of them)

I just cared that I could enjoy seeing some Super Mario action on the big screen with my little guy.

We laughed, we cried, we cheered, and we got excited when our favorite characters showed up on the screen (Donkey Kong for me, Peach for my daughter Max, and of course, Mario for Kit).

But—surprisingly—my evaluation of Super Mario's Quality didn't quite line up with the reviews I saw.

Witless and pandering?

How could we end up at such a diffent evaluation of Quality?

This is (of course) an absurd question.
I might as well ask, "How can people have different opinions?"

But I do believe it's a useful question to ask, even if it's absurd.
