# Searching for Quality

Quality fled across the desert, and the wordslinger followed.

My favorite series of all time just might be the Dark Tower by Stephen King. The opening line irresistably sucks you in, "The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed." It's impossible to stop reading. It's better than Harry Potter. Dare I say it? It's better than Lord of The Rings. (If they can't find me after this, you know which fan-base to investigate first.) But mega-fanbase or not, the Dark Tower series is of the highest Quality.

I invite you to join me on a search for Quality. Like The Gunslinger's opening line, the idea of Quality irresistibly pulls me in. What on earth is it? More importantly: how can I have it? How can I make it? If the answer is obvious to you, it's not to me. I've tried so many times to capture Quality, only for it to slip through my fingers. I can assure you honestly at the outset that I have no idea where this search will lead.

So, let's begin our search. And although searching for Quality in my favorite series would seem a sensible thing to do, I feel compelled to first look somewhere a bit more lighthearted. So, instead, let's turn our attention to Super Mario. 

Please hear me out as I assert this is a movie of highest Quality.

I'm joking, right? It's a fun movie, sure. But high Quality? Surely I should be embarassed to mention "The Super Mario Bros" in the same post about Quality and "Lord of The Rings."

Shouldn't it matter that: Chris Pratt doesn't know how to do an itialian accent? Half the scenes are in slow-motion? It's clearly trying to jumpstart a cinematic universe? They never really bother to explain *why* the mario bros are sucked into another universe? 

No!

Why not? Because of this guy:

![Kit + Mario](/image/kit_mario.jpg)

My son Kit *loves* Mario. Mario Kart is his favorite game. Catch him in his Super Mario shirt, his Mario Kart shirt, or (in cold weather) his Super Mario sweater. Did I mention he asked for (and got) a Mario themed birthday this year? So, when I went to see the Super Mario Bros movie, I didn't care about: the animation style, the soundtrack, or the story. Although, to be honest, I liked all of them. I just cared that I could enjoy seeing some Super Mario action on the big screen with my little guy. 

We laughed, we cried, and we cheered when our favorite characters showed up on the screen (Donkey Kong for me, Peach for my daughter Max, and of course, Mario for Kit). We walked out of that movie with smiles on our faces and Quality in our hearts.

When we arrived at home, I began my routine of learning what others thought about the movie. Surely this would be a smashing hit; "recommended viewing for fathers and sons everywhere!" Surprisingly, my evaluation of Super Mario's Quality didn't quite line up with the critics.

Witless and pandering? How could we end up at such a diffent evaluation of Quality? This is (of course) an absurd question. I might as well ask, "How can people have different opinions?" But I do believe it's a useful question to ask, even if it's absurd. Indeed, you might say this question is an important part of an entire Philsophy field: esthetics. Esthetics (or aesthetics) is focused on the idea of value judgement. 

At the beginning of our search I unknowingly laid out our ultimate esthetic goal: to discover what quality is and how to harness it.

Now, it seems, I must first answer a more fundamental esthetic question: how can two people end up with opposing assessments of quality for the same thing?

This question is more difficult that it seems. You might respond, "because they like different things" but this presents problems too. If quality is only opinion or what we like, why do we bother with arguments at all? We could simply state, "I like this" or "I don't like this." Instead, we state, "The Super Mario Bros movie was excellent because..." giving our reasons for why we believe it is not just Quality to us but Quality for all.

Because of this problem, I believe there is something deeper going on with Quality than "mere" opinion. So, before I can answer my esthetic question, I must first figure out what Quality is. To figure out what it is, I must figure out where to look.

I must answer: where does Quality exist? In the observer or the observed?

![Fundamental Esthetic Question](/image/fundamental_esthetic_question.png)

There are reasons to believe Quality could exist on either side. For the observer, we know an assessment of Quality can differ between people. That's the basis for this entire discussion. On the other side, we know a person may change their assessment based on the object observed. They may also change their assessment based on changes to the observed object.

When discussing the Quality of Super Mario, I might attempt a rational analysis of the film. Did the story have plot holes? Was the lore consistent with canon? Were the characters true to their game counterparts? These "objective" or *a priori* methods of analysis might yield answers but they cannot reveal Quality because I still don't know where Quality exists. I don't know if I'm asking the right questions to reveal Quality.

I'm hardly the first person to think objective assessments of quality are problematic. Take a look at this quote from the philosopher Kant, from all the way back in the year 1790.

> If someone takes me to ~~a play~~ **the Super Mario movie** and it pleases my taste, then he can adduce all the rules established as proofs that the ~~play~~ **movie** lacks ~~beauty~~ **Quality**. I will stop my ears, listen to no reasons and arguments, and would rather believe that those rules of the critics are false than allow that my judgment should be determined by means of *a priori* grounds of proof, since it is supposed to be a judgment of taste and not of the understanding of reason.
> 
> Immanuel Kant
> *Critique of the Power of Judgment* (paraphrase)

Immanuel Kant goes to the Super Mario movie, finding himself deeply moved by the film. Afterwards, he reads a scathing review from The New York Times movie critic. The critic claims Super Mario was witless and pandering. Does Kant care? Kant does not care. He stuffs his fingers into his ears, chanting, "I can't hear you!" He argues the critic relies on *a priori* justifications for his critique. Meaning, the critic decided with reason alone—without emperical evidence—the movie should be witty and should not pander to superfan or childish desires. So, Kant shoots back his retort—complete with *a priori* justification—the movie should pander and need not be witty at all. His justifications are not important here. The point is that he is not moved by the critic's argument.

What's this all about? Kant is saying arguments and reasons are not relevant when assessing traits such as goodness, beauty, or Quality. It is for each person to decide if the object fits the mold. He is not saying, "man is the measure of all things" but "each man is the measure of all things"—at least when it comes to esthetics.

Now, this is a total bummer. Not for the subjecivist—content to lean against the fence to watch Quality graze—but absolutely for the person who desires to grab Quality by the horns and ride it into town. This is not to say that ones opinion is *merely* an opinion, without worth or weight of its own. It's simply to say that it's not *useful* for anyone who wants to consistently replicate Quality. That is my goal, so I must continue on.

So, we must continue if we are to find anything useful. But continue where? For now, my only idea is to investigate the word *quality*: what does it mean? where does it come from?

First, the easy part. What does it mean? For this, I'll consult Webster's 1913 dictionary; the last edition written and edited by lexicographer Noah Webster.

> **Quality**
> Noun
> 1. That which makes, or helps to make, anything such as it is; anything belonging to a subject, or predicable of it; distinguishing property, characteristic, or attribute.
> <br />
> 2. The condition of being of such a sort as distinguished from others; nature or character relatively considered, as of goods; character; rank.

We seem to have two types of Quality. The first is that which makes something what it is, its attributes (little-q "quality"). The second is that which distinguishes something from others, its rank (big-Q "Quality").

These are the definitions of quality. However, the dictionary includes another tidbit right at the top: *L. qualitas*. Indicating the etymology of this word; it comes from the Latin *qualitas*. The term was coined by Cicero; unsurprisingly, as he wrote three quarters of extant Latin writing from his time. Qualitas, in turn, is a calque of the ancient Greek "ποιότης" (poiótēs), literally: "the state of being (-της) a certain nature (ποιός)".

![Little-q quality](/image/little_q_quality.png)

Little-q quality (ποιότης) appears in ancient Greek philosophy. Like in Plato's dialogue, Theaetetus, where he investigates the nature of knowledge.

> **Socrates:**
> Now perhaps quality *(ποιότης)* seems an extraordinary word, and you do not understand it when used with general application, so let me give particular examples. For the active element becomes neither heat nor whiteness, but hot or white, and other things in the same way.

Here, quality is "hot" and "white"; quality is attributes. You might say this is the quality of the observed. This type of quality is easily observed, defined, and quantified. It's certainly not the Quality Kant referred to, saying he'd cover his ears if you dared contradict him. No, I expect he'd not cover his ears like a toddler, screaming, "it's not BLUE it's RED" when you attempt to describe the sky.

So, here I suggest we pivot to the other. The Quality of, "goods; character; rank" according to our friend Webster. But here, he and his dictionary are of no further help to us. We've already tracked the etymology he provided and it led only to little-q quality. 

To get us started, we can (carefully) venture into the world of pop-philosophy. Robert M. Pirsig provides us with a few ideas in his philosophical novel "Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance". But we must tread carefully here, as many of his ideas are verifiably false. However, they may be salvageable yet.

Pirsig explores the idea of Quality through the lens of an insane philosopher, Phaedrus. Eventually, Phaedrus runs across an ancient Greek definition if Quality.

> "What moves the Greek warrior to deeds of heroism is not a sense of duty as we understand it...duty towards others: it is rather duty towards himself. He strives after that which we translate ‘virtue’ but is in Greek **areté** (ἀρετή), ‘excellence’—we shall have much to say about areté. It runs through Greek life." 
> 
> There, Phædrus thinks, is a definition of Quality that existed a thousand years ago.

Now this is an interesting definition of Quality, but it doesn't move the needle for us. "Excellence" is clearly related to big-Q Quality but is hardly different in definition than Quality. We don't know where it resides. 

Also, Pirsig gets confused. He believes the Greeks *only* had this word for Quality (and quality). But just a moment ago, we saw definitively that they had two words: ἀρετή (areté) and ποιότης (poiótēs) — big Q and little q quality, respectively. Even so, it's clear at some point the two concepts merged into one: quality.

![Etymology of Quality](/image/etymology_of_quality.png)

Now, if only Pirsig had looked a little further, he might have found this quote from Aristotle in his *Nicomachean Ethics*.

> It must then be premised that all excellence **(areté)** has a twofold effect on the thing to which it belongs: it not only renders the thing itself good, but it also causes it to perform its function well. For example, the effect of excellence **(areté)** in the eye is that the eye is good and functions well; since having good eyes means having good sight. Similarly excellence **(areté)** in a horse makes it a good horse, and also good at galloping, at carrying its rider, and at facing the enemy.

Now we're cooking! Not excellence but *fulfillment of purpose*. This definition changes everything about big-Q Quality. It's no longer a mystical, subjective "Excellence" but a specific *event*: the moment an object fulfills its purpose. Quality is not a *thing*. Quality is an *event*!

![The Intersection of Quality](/image/the_quality_intersection.png)

Why is this so important? Well, we can't find and measure Quality in an object; likewise, we can't measure internal, subjective definitions of excellence; but we can state our purposes and expectations, then measure when they are met.

When we meet with an object that fails to satisfy our expectations, we do not find Quality. But when we meet with an object that satisfies (or exceeds, or redefines) our expectations, we find Quality.

![What intersects?](/image/what_intersects.png)

Here's what it looks like to evaluate this definition of Quality.

1. We must figure out Quality for *who*? It might be Quality for myself, or another. 
2. Next, we state the expectations. This could still be subjective, "I want to have a good time" or it could be objective, "I want to increase revenue by 5%".
3. Finally, we look for the meeting of expectations. This could be as simple as asking, "Did you have a good time?" or as methodical as a scientific measurement.
