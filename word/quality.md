# Quality

Let's begin our discussion of Quality with Super Mario. I assert this is a movie of highest Quality.

Does it matter that: Chris Pratt doesn't know how to do an itialian accent? Half the scenes are in slow-motion? It's clearly trying to jumpstart a cinematic universe? They never really bother to explain *why* the mario bros are sucked into another universe? No!

Why not? Because of this guy:

My son Kit *loves* Mario. Mario Kart is his favorite game. Catch him in his Super Mario shirt, his Mario Kart shirt, or (in cold weather) his Super Mario sweater. Did I mention that he asked for (and got) a Mario themed birthday this year? So, when I went to see the Super Mario Bros movie, I didn't care about: the animation quality, the soundtrack, or the story. Although, to be honest, I liked all of them. I just cared that I could enjoy seeing some Super Mario action on the big screen with my little guy. 

We laughed, we cried, we cheered, and we got excited when our favorite characters showed up on the screen (Donkey Kong for me, Peach for my daughter Max, and of course, Mario for Kit). But—surprisingly—my evaluation of Super Mario's Quality didn't quite line up with the reviews I saw.

Witless and pandering? How could we end up at such a diffent evaluation of Quality? This is (of course) an absurd question. I might as well ask, "How can people have different opinions?" But I do believe it's a useful question to ask, even if it's absurd. Indeed, you might say this question is entire Philsophy field: esthetics. Esthetics (or aesthetics) is focused on the idea of value judgement. In particular, where does value reside: in the observer or the observed?

Why is this a fundamental esthetic question? Because if you place quality in the observer, then quality is merely opinion. However, we can't place quality in the object alone because there are clearly different beliefs about what quality is. Perhaps more importantly, we can't place quality solely in the observed because we can't physically find and study Quality.

When discussing the Quality of Super Mario, we might attempt a rational analysis of the film. Did the story have plot holes? Was the lore consistent with canon? Were the characters true to their game counterparts? These "objective" methods of analysis might yield answers but they cannot reveal quality because we still don't know where quality exists. We don't know if we're asking the right questions to reveal Quality.

I'm hardly the first person to ask this question. 

> If someone takes me to ~~a play~~ **the Super Mario movie** that in the end fails to please my taste, then he can adduce all the rules established as proofs that the ~~play~~ **movie** is beautiful. I will stop my ears, listen to no reasons and arguments, and would rather believe that those rules of the critics are false than allow that my judgment should be determined by means of *a priori* grounds of proof, since it is supposed to be a judgment of taste and not of the understanding of reason.
