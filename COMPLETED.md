## Fixes Applied

### Nature Page Alignment Fix (Completed)
- **Problem**: Nature page had different header/footer templates and outdated copyright year
- **Solution**: Updated nature/main.html.tmpl to use shared header and footer templates
- **Files Modified**:
  - nature/main.html.tmpl: Replaced custom header/footer with shared templates
- **Result**: Nature page now consistent with rest of site while preserving unique photo grid layout
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - ~~Different header navigation (shows Poems/Stories/Thoughts/Projects instead of GitHub/LinkedIn/Email)~~
  - ~~Has toggle menu button not present on other pages~~
  - ~~Different footer structure and styling~~
  - ~~Footer shows "© 2024" instead of "© 2025" like other pages~~

### Font Loading Accessibility Fix (Completed)
- **Problem**: JavaScript was hiding content with `visibility: hidden` during font loading
- **Solution**: Removed all font loading JavaScript and rely on CSS `font-display: swap`
- **Files Modified**:
  - Emptied 13 JavaScript files (main.js, poem/main.js, aphorism/main.js, etc.)
  - Removed script includes from 14 template files
- **Result**: Content now always visible (with brief font swap flash), but Browser MCP tool still cannot detect content
- **Conclusion**: The accessibility issue is deeper than font loading - may be a Browser MCP tool limitation or other rendering issue

### CSS Animation Accessibility Fix (Completed)
- **Problem**: Elements starting with `opacity: 0` for animations were inaccessible to Browser MCP tool
- **Solution**: Changed animation approach from `opacity: 0` + `forwards` to using `animation-fill-mode: both`
- **Files Modified**:
  - main.css: Fixed `.featured-post`, `.section-link`, and `.category-card` classes
- **Result**: 
  - Homepage Explore navigation now detected by Browser MCP tool (partial improvement)
  - Poem and Aphorism content still not detected (appears to be a deeper Browser MCP tool limitation)
  - Content is always visible in HTML and accessible to users

## Resolved Issues

### Content Issues
- **RESOLVED**: "The Philosophy of Lovers" story is marked as draft (intentional - not ready for publication)

### False Positives (Verified as Working)
- **FALSE POSITIVE**: Word headings for Quality and Flexible are actually present (not empty h2 tags)
- **FALSE POSITIVE**: /tags/poetry link exists and returns valid HTML (not broken)
- **FALSE POSITIVE**: Footer links (Aphorism, Project/Make, Nature) ARE visible from homepage in the Explore section

### Design Issues Fixed
- **FIXED**: Nature page has completely different design/navigation
- **FIXED**: Nature page shows "© 2024" while all others show "© 2025"
